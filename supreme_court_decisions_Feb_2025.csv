"A.C. No. 14203 - MAMERTA C. LIZADA, BENITO CUIZON, ABELARDO CUIZON, AND ENRIQUE CUIZON, COMPLAINANTS, VS. ATTY. DEMOSTHENES S. TECSON, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N - Supreme Court E-Library","A.C. No. 14203 MAMERTA C. LIZADA, BENITO CUIZON, ABELARDO CUIZON, AND ENRIQUE CUIZON, COMPLAINANTS, VS. ATTY. DEMOSTHENES S. TECSON, RESPONDENT. February 18, 2025",,"This is an administrative Complaint[1] for disbarment filed against Atty. Demosthenes S. Tecson (Atty. Tecson) for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) due to his alleged failure to remit to the complainants Mamerta C. Lizada, Benito Cuizon, Abelardo Cuizon, and Enrique Cuizon (Lizada et al.) the total amount of PHP 67,170,982.57, representing half of the latter's just compensation.[2]Lizada et al. are the legal heirs of the late Spouses Leoncio Cuizon and Mamerta Seno (Spouses Cuizon).[3]Lizada et al. alleged that Spouses Cuizon were the registered owners of several parcels of land located in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu with a total area of 14,161.75 square meters.[4] On January 28, 1981, the Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZA)[5] sought the expropriation of said parcels of land for the development of an export processing zone in Lapu-Lapu City.[6] As such, Spouses Cuizon hired Atty. Tecson to represent them in the expropriation proceedings.[7]On September 24, 2015, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu rendered its Judgment, finding the expropriation proper, and fixing the just compensation at PHP 2,500.00 per square meter, with legal interest of 12% per annum from January 28, 1981 until full payment.[8] The computed amount of just compensation including accumulated interest is PHP 134,341,965.15, which amount was eventually paid by the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) on December 23, 2015.[9]The check representing the total just compensation was received by Atty. Tecson who, in turn, remitted the amount of PHP 13,434,196.51 to each of the complainants, or a total of PHP 53,736,786.04.[10] Notably, Lizada et al. expected to receive PHP 26,868,393.03 each and were thus surprised when they received only half of the said amount.[11]The remaining PHP 13,434,196.51, which is equal to each individual share of Lizada et al., was kept by Atty. Tecson as his attorney's fees.[12] With respect to the remaining PHP 67,170,982.57, Atty. Tecson simply told Lizada et al. that the same will be allotted to former Department of Justice Secretary Leila De Lima in support of her senatorial bid.[13]In his Brief,[14] Atty. Tecson admitted that he was engaged by the estate administrator of Spouses Cuizon as their counsel in the expropriation proceedings brought against them.[15] Atty. Tecson likewise admitted that he suggested to Lizada et al. the engagement of a ""PR"" man to ensure and expedite the payment of their just compensation.[16] Furthermore, Atty. Tecson admitted that he received the PHP 134,341,965.15 just compensation and remitted only PHP 13,434,196.51 each to Lizada et al. Lastly, he admitted that he kept PHP 13,434,196.51 as his legal fees, and that the PHP 67,170,982.00 was given to the PR man responsible for the expeditious payment by PEZA of Lizada et al.'s just compensation.[17]In his defense, Atty. Tecson averred that the engagement of the PR man was with the conformity of Lizada et al.[18]Findings and Recommendations of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP)The IBP Investigating Commissioner (IC)[19] found that Atty. Tecson violated Canon III of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA).[20] Accordingly, Atty. Tecson's admission that he advised Lizada et al. to hire a PR man and that he personally handed the supposed ""share"" or ""facilitation fee"" to the PR man is a clear proof of his violation of his duty of fidelity. In addition, the IC found that Atty. Tecson violated his fiduciary duty to account for the money belonging to Lizada et al. by failing to return half of the latter's just compensation. Finally, the IC noted that Atty. Tecson failed to timely file his verified answer and position paper. For the IC, this further shows Atty. Tecson's deliberate failure to respect the law and the tribunal.[21]Based on the above findings, the IC recommended that Atty. Tecson be disbarred, and that he be ordered to return the amount of PHP 67,170,982.57 to Lizada et al. with 6% interest per annum until fully paid.[22]In a Resolution dated January 13, 2024, the IBP Board of Governors (IBP Board) resolved to approve and adopt the Report and Recommendation of the IC to impose the penalty of disbarment upon Atty. Tecson. However, the IBP Board disapproved the recommendation of the IC that Atty. Tecson be likewise obliged to return the sum of PHP 67,170,982.57. Accordingly, Lizada et al. knew that said amount was given to a third party as payment of the latter's services.[23]The Court's RulingThe Court adopts the findings and approves the recommendation of the IBP Board to disbar Atty. Tecson. However, the Court finds that Atty. Tecson should likewise be ordered to return to Lizada et al. the sum of PHP 67,170,982.57, with legal interest.Applicability of the CPRAThe verified Complaint for disbarment was instituted against Atty. Tecson before the effectivity of the CPRA. This notwithstanding, the propriety of Atty. Tecson's conduct shall be determined applying the CPRA pursuant to the CPRA's transitory provision which states:Section 1. Transitory provision. â The CPRA shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except to the extent that in the opinion of the Supreme Court, its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern.Since it does not appear to the Court that the retroactive application of the CPRA is not feasible or would work injustice to any of the parties, the Court shall resolve this case applying the provisions of the CPRA. Atty. Tecson failed to observe and live up to his duty of fidelity under Canon III of the CPRA The CPRA provides that a lawyer must observe fidelity in all his dealings. Under Canon III of the CPRA, fidelity ""pertains to a lawyer's duty to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the land, to assist in the administration of justice as an officer of the court, and to advance or defend a client's cause, with full devotion, genuine interest, and zeal in the pursuit of truth and justice."" This duty of a lawyer is further clarified in Section 2 thereof, to wit:Section 2. The responsible and accountable lawyer. â A lawyer shall uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of the land, promote respect for laws and legal processes, safeguard human rights, and at all times advance the honor and integrity of the legal profession.As an officer of the court, a lawyer shall uphold the rule of law and conscientiously assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice.As an advocate, a lawyer shall represent the client with fidelity and zeal within the bounds of the law and the CPRA.From the foregoing, the fidelity expected of a lawyer does not mean unbridled loyalty to their client's cause. Far from it, fidelity pertains to a lawyer's faithfulness to the rule of law. Thus, in advocating for their client's interests, a lawyer must always observe the law and legal processes. They must never give inappropriate or illegal advice or pursue an illicit course of action. On the contrary, they must consistently conduct themselves in a manner that upholds and reinforces the rule of law and the efficient administration of justice. After all, as aptly put by the Court in Jimenez v. Verano, Jr.,[24] ""[t]he primary duty of lawyers is not to their clients but to the administration of justice. To that end, their clients' success is wholly subordinate.""[25]Here, Atty. Tecson miserably failed to live up to his duty to uphold the rule of law and to assist in the efficient administration of justice. Instead of advising his clients to go through the regular process of execution, he deliberately chose to cut short and undermine such legal process by advising his clients to bribe. What is more shocking to the Court is Atty. Tecson's unabashed admission of his role in the bribery. He readily admitted that he suggested to engage a PR man without any showing of remorse or intimation that he was at least aware of the wrongfulness of his action.An integral part of a lawyer's duty of fidelity is their duty to account for their client's properties during and after the lawyer-client relationship. During the existence of the lawyer-client relationship, Canon III, Section 49 of the CPRA defines the nature and extent of this duty as follows, to wit:Section 49. Accounting during engagement. â A lawyer, during the existence of the lawyer-client relationship, shall account for and prepare an inventory of any fund or property belonging to the client, whether received from the latter or from a third person, immediately upon such receipt.When funds are entrusted to a lawyer by a client for a specific purpose, the lawyer shall use such funds only for the client's declared purpose. Any unused amount of the entrusted funds shall be promptly returned to the client upon accomplishment of the stated purpose or the client's demand.Unlike in Rule 16.01 of the CPR which simply states that a lawyer must account for all money or property collected or received for or from a client, the CPRA now clearly defines the nature and extent of this duty, both during the existence of the lawyer-client relationship and after its termination.As provided above, the lawyer's duty to account during engagement commences immediately upon their receipt of the fund or property belonging to the client. This duty includes the following, to wit: (a) preparing an inventory for said fund or property, (b) using the same for the stated purpose, and (c) promptly returning the unused portion thereof to the client upon demand or upon the accomplishment of the stated purpose. Of course, when the lawyer claims to have spent or utilized the client's money or property for the stated purpose, it is incumbent upon them to show proof thereof.Here, Atty. Tecson admitted having received from the RTC, on behalf of Lizada et al., the total amount of PHP 134,341,965.15. However, only half thereof, or PHP 67,170,982.57, was accounted for. The amount of PHP 67,170,982.57 was not returned to Lizada et al. as the same was purportedly given as payment to the PR man. With these established facts, the question that the Court now resolves is whether Atty. Tecson, as part of his duty to account, has the obligation to return to Lizada et al. the amount of PHP 67,170,982.57.For the IC, Atty. Tecson must return said amount, albeit without a clear explanation why. The IC simply stated that such an obligation to return is based on his duty to account. The IBP Board, on the other hand, opined that Atty. Tecson has no obligation to return because said amount was purportedly given to the PR man with the conformity of Lizada et al. The Court cannot agree with the IBP Board's findings and recommendation.As previously stated, a lawyer's duty to account includes their duty to promptly give or return to the client the latter's fund or property upon the latter's demand, unless of course the lawyer has spent or utilized the same for the client's stated purpose. In Dizon v. Trinidad-Radoc,[26] the Court ruled that if the lawyer fails to return said fund or property upon demand, it is presumed that the lawyer misappropriated the same for their own use to the prejudice and in violation of the trust reposed in them by the client.[27]The Court finds that Lizada et al. demanded Atty. Tecson to remit to them the amount of PHP 67,170,982.57. For one, no litigant will simply let go of their hard-fought monetary award, especially when it is worth millions of pesos. Moreover, there is no indication from the records that Lizada et al. waived said unremitted amount or that they instructed Atty. Tecson to use or spend the same for a specified purpose. On the contrary, Lizada et al. clearly articulated their surprise when they received only half of what is due them, and their disappointment when they were told that their unremitted share will be given to Sen. De Lima in support of her senatorial bid. Parts of Lizada et al.'s verified Complaint read as follows, to wit:8. That unfortunately, however, when the check was encashed by Atty. Demosthenes Tecson on the said date (December 23, 2015) before the drawee bank (Land Bank of the Philippines, MEPZA Branch), thinking that we will be receiving in a pro indiviso share as per check issued by the PEZA in the name of Atty. Demosthenes Tecson, the latter only gave each of one us (sic) . . . the amount of only THIRTEEN MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX PESOS AND FIFTY ONE CENTAVOS ([PHP] 13,434,196.51) instead of TWENTY SIX MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE PESOS AND THREE CENTAVOS ([PHP] 26,868,393.03) Pesos, including the attorney's fee of Atty. Demosthenes Tecson;9. That we asked Atty. Demosthenes Tecson, why it is only PHP 13,434,196.51 representing our share ..., but Atty. Demosthenes Tecson told us he got also PHP 13,434,196.51 as his sixth (5th) (sic) share representing as his attorney's fee and that the fifty (50%) percent of the total amount of PHP 134,341,965.15 which is in the amount of PHP 67,170,982.575 shall be allotted to Department of Justice Secretary Laila Delima (sic).for she is running as a candidate for Senator this coming May 9, 2016 National Election[.][28] (Emphasis supplied)Since Lizada et al. demanded Atty. Tecson to return to them PHP 67,170,982.57, which represents the unremitted portion of their just compensation, the presumption that Atty. Tecson misappropriated the same for his benefit attaches. It is now incumbent upon Atty. Tecson to overcome such presumption by presenting evidence that he utilized the said amount for its intended purpose. Unfortunately, Atty. Tecson failed to do so. Atty. Tecson merely alleged, without anything to substantiate the same, that said amount was given to a PR man with the conformity of Lizada et al. Relevant parts of Atty. Tecson's Brief read as follows, to wit:13. On July 8, 2015[,] the respondent filed a motion for summary judgment which was subsequently followed with similar motion by Ms. Igot new counsel Atty. Santiago L. Ortiz, Jr., and apprehensive of another more waiting time with the pending intervention then represented by Atty. Manuel F. Ong that the respondent suggested to his clients to engage the services of a 3rd person as PR man to insure and expedite payment of their 14,162 sq. meter-patrimony to which complainants willingly agreed as long as the .former shall take care of pursuing it;14. After contracting a PR man who proposed that 50% out of PEZA/MEPZ payment would be the compensation for the services rendered that the respondent conferred with his clients who unanimously accepted the condition with some inquiries where the 50% of the PR man will go to which the respondent superficially opined that maybe some candidates will benefit therefrom as national election is forthcoming by May 14 the following year, and not to mind the disposition by the PR man of his 50% for the complainants could inevitably receive and enjoy their shares after 35 long years of battle in Court;....19. As soon as their turn came to get their share at about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of December 23, 2015, the respondent thru his newlyÂ­opened Savings Account No. 2431-0112-66 with the LBP MEZ, spontaneously signed withdrawal slips and turned over [PHP] 13,434,196.51 cash each to complainants Mamerta C. Lizada, in behalf of Hrs. of Rosalia C. Rivera, Enrique S. Cuizon, duly assisted by his daughter Ida Cuizon, Benito T. Cuizon, also assisted by his wife and Abelardo S. Cuizon who is assisted by his daughter. Thereafter, the respondent also turned over immediately the 50% due the PR man inside the Land Bank office equivalent to [PHP] 67,170,982.00 which were placed inside carton boxes and loaded into his car waiting near the door outside the LBP office and this fact was admitted by the complainants during their conference at Cebu City IBP Office.[29] (Emphasis supplied)To reiterate, the aforequoted assertions by Atty. Tecson have no accompanying proof. He merely alleged that Lizada et al. ""willingly agreed"" to his proposal to engage the services of a PR man, and ""unanimously accepted"" his proposal to use 50% of their just compensation to pay said PR man. Likewise, there is nothing in the records which supports Atty. Tecson's claim that Lizada et al. admitted during the conference at the Cebu City IBP Office that the PHP 67,170,982.57 was given to the PR man. Since Atty. Tecson failed to establish his allegations, the presumption that he misappropriated said amount remains unrebutted. Consequently, the Court finds that Atty. Tecson violated his duty to account and is thus liable to return to the Lizada et al. the full amount of PHP 67,170,982.57, with legal interest.Lest our discussions above be misinterpreted, the Court clarifies that even if Atty. Tecson was able to establish his allegations that the PHP 67,170,982.57 was indeed given to the PR man with the conformity of Lizada et al., he will still be found guilty of violating his duty to account and, consequently, he will still be directed to return said amount to Lizada et al.As previously stated, a lawyer's duty to account is an integral part of their duty of fidelity. We have also previously stated that a lawyer's duty of fidelity does not mean blind loyalty to their client's cause. Rather, fidelity means faithfulness to the rule of law. Based on these premises, a lawyer's duty to account, which includes their duty to spend or use the client's funds for its stated purpose, must necessarily align with their duty of fidelity. In other words, it is incumbent upon the lawyer, as part of their duty of fidelity, to spend or use their client's funds only for a lawful purpose.A lawyer, therefore, shall not advise their client to use the latter's funds or properties for an illicit purpose. In the same vein, a lawyer cannot just blindly obey their client's instructions on how the latter's funds or properties are to be utilized. Should the client instruct a lawyer to use or spend their funds for an illicit purpose, the lawyer has the legal duty to advise such client of the illegality of the latter's desired course of action, and the professional duty to propose a legal alternative. If the client insists on their instructions to use their funds for an illicit purpose, the lawyer is not without recourse. In such a situation, the lawyer may terminate the lawyer-client relationship.[30]Necessarily, if the lawyer advises their client to use the latter's funds for an illicit purpose, or if they accede to the client's instructions to use said funds for an illicit purpose, said lawyer violates their duty to account even if the client agrees to their advice or if said lawyer simply accedes to their client's instructions. Elsewise stated, if a lawyer uses their client's funds for an unlawful purpose, said lawyer cannot tenably invoke the defense that the client agreed to such use, or that said use is upon the client's instructions.A lawyer, therefore, has the responsibility to always ensure that the expenditure or utilization of the client's funds or properties is in accordance with law. If a lawyer fails to observe this duty, they must return to the client the latter's unlawfully spent funds upon the client's demand.The appropriate penaltyCanon VI, Section 33 of the CPRA expressly classifies the following offenses as serious, namely: (1) Gross misconduct, or any inexcusable, shameful or flagrant unlawful conduct; (2) Bribery or corruption; and (3) Misappropriating a client's funds or properties. Canon VI, Section 37 of the CPRA, on the other hand, provides that the penalty to be imposed on the respondent who is found guilty of a serious offense is any of the following or a combination thereof, to wit: (1) Disbarment; (2) Suspension from the practice of law for a period exceeding six (6) months; (3) Revocation of notarial commission and disqualification as a notary for not less than two (2) years; or (4) Fine exceeding PHP 100,000.00.As already discussed above, Atty. Tecson violated his duty to account by misappropriating a staggering amount of PHP 67,170,982.57 representing half of Lizada et al.'s just compensation. Worse, Atty. Tecson remorselessly admitted that he used the said amount to pay the services of a PR man to facilitate and expedite the payment of Lizada et al.'s just compensation. There is no doubt then that Atty. Tecson's infraction is a serious offense as contemplated under Canon VI, Section 33 of the CPRA because it constitutes gross misconduct and misappropriation of a client's funds or properties.Anent the penalty for Atty. Tecson's acts, the Court finds the penalty of disbarment appropriate.The Court's decision to impose upon Atty. Tecson the maximum penalty of disbarment is not without precedent. In similar cases where respondent lawyers misappropriated their clients' money or engaged in bribery or corruption, the Court imposed upon them the penalty of disbarment from the practice of law.In Freeman v. Atty. Reyes,[31] the Court disbarred the respondent lawyer who misappropriated the insurance proceeds of her client's deceased husband.In CF Sharp Crew Management, Inc. v. Torres,[32] the Court likewise disbarred the respondent lawyer who repeatedly requested the issuance of checks purportedly for settling seafarers' claims, only to have such checks deposited to an unauthorized bank account.In Bueno v. Atty. RaÃ±eses,[33] the Court disbarred a lawyer who, among others, solicited money from his client purportedly to bribe a judge in order to ensure a favorable judgment in favor of the client.In Rodco Consultancy and Maritime Services Corporation v. Atty. Concepcion,[34] the Court likewise disbarred a lawyer who solicited money from his client purportedly for the purpose of paying someone in the Court of Appeals to expedite and facilitate a favorable resolution in favor of his client. On top of this, the respondent lawyer failed to properly account the money he received from his client.Atty. Tecson's infraction is so egregious, exhibiting his moral depravity and complete disregard of his responsibilities as a member of the bar.Atty. Tecson is also directed to return to Lizada et al. the amount of PHP 67,170,982.57, with interest at the rate of 6% per annum, from the finality of this Decision until full payment.ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Atty. Demosthenes S. Tecson GUILTY of Gross Misconduct under Section 33(a) and misappropriating his clients' funds under Section 33(g) of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. He is DISBARRED and his name is to be STRICKEN OFF the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately.Atty. Demosthenes S. Tecson is also ORDERED to IMMEDIATELY RETURN to the complainants Marnerta C. Lizada, Benito Cuizon, Abelardo Cuizon, and Enrique Cuizon the amount of PHP 67,170,982.57, with interest of 6% per annum, reckoned from the date of finality of this Decision, until full payment. He is further DIRECTED to submit to this Court proof of payment within 10 days from said payment.Let copies of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant to l5e entered into the records of respondent Atty. Demosthenes S. Tecson.

Demosthenes S. Tecson (Atty. Tecson) for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) due to his alleged failure to remit to the complainants Mamerta C. Lizada, Benito Cuizon, Abelardo Cuizon, and Enrique Cuizon (Lizada et al.) the total amount of PHP 67,170,982.57, representing half of the latter's just compensation.[2]Lizada et al. are the legal heirs of the late Spouses Leoncio Cuizon and Mamerta Seno (Spouses Cuizon).[3]Lizada et al. alleged that Spouses Cuizon were the registered owners of several parcels of land located in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu with a total area of 14,161.75 square meters.[4] On January 28, 1981, the Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZA)[5] sought the expropriation of said parcels of land for the development of an export processing zone in Lapu-Lapu City.[6] As such, Spouses Cuizon hired Atty.

Tecson who, in turn, remitted the amount of PHP 13,434,196.51 to each of the complainants, or a total of PHP 53,736,786.04.[10] Notably, Lizada et al. expected to receive PHP 26,868,393.03 each and were thus surprised when they received only half of the said amount.[11]The remaining PHP 13,434,196.51, which is equal to each individual share of Lizada et al., was kept by Atty. Tecson as his attorney's fees.[12] With respect to the remaining PHP 67,170,982.57, Atty. Tecson simply told Lizada et al. that the same will be allotted to former Department of Justice Secretary Leila De Lima in support of her senatorial bid.[13]In his Brief,[14] Atty. Tecson admitted that he was engaged by the estate administrator of Spouses Cuizon as their counsel in the expropriation proceedings brought against them.[15] Atty. Tecson likewise admitted that he suggested to Lizada et al. the engagement of a ""PR"" man to ensure and expedite the payment of their just compensation.[16] Furthermore, Atty. Tecson admitted that he received the PHP 134,341,965.15 just compensation and remitted only PHP 13,434,196.51 each to Lizada et al. Lastly, he admitted that he kept PHP 13,434,196.51 as his legal fees, and that the PHP 67,170,982.00 was given to the PR man responsible for the expeditious payment by PEZA of Lizada et al.'s just compensation.[17]In his defense, Atty. Tecson averred that the engagement of the PR man was with the conformity of Lizada et al.[18]Findings and Recommendations of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP)The IBP Investigating Commissioner (IC)[19] found that Atty. Tecson violated Canon III of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA).[20] Accordingly, Atty. Tecson's admission that he advised Lizada et al. to hire a PR man and that he personally handed the supposed ""share"" or ""facilitation fee"" to the PR man is a clear proof of his violation of his duty of fidelity. In addition, the IC found that Atty. Tecson violated his fiduciary duty to account for the money belonging to Lizada et al. by failing to return half of the latter's just compensation. Finally, the IC noted that Atty. Tecson failed to timely file his verified answer and position paper. For the IC, this further shows Atty. Tecson's deliberate failure to respect the law and the tribunal.[21]Based on the above findings, the IC recommended that Atty. Tecson be disbarred, and that he be ordered to return the amount of PHP 67,170,982.57 to Lizada et al. with 6% interest per annum until fully paid.[22]In a Resolution dated January 13, 2024, the IBP Board of Governors (IBP Board) resolved to approve and adopt the Report and Recommendation of the IC to impose the penalty of disbarment upon Atty.

Tecson before the effectivity of the CPRA. This notwithstanding, the propriety of Atty. Tecson's conduct shall be determined applying the CPRA pursuant to the CPRA's transitory provision which states:Section 1. Transitory provision. â The CPRA shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except to the extent that in the opinion of the Supreme Court, its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern.Since it does not appear to the Court that the retroactive application of the CPRA is not feasible or would work injustice to any of the parties, the Court shall resolve this case applying the provisions of the CPRA. Atty. Tecson failed to observe and live up to his duty of fidelity under Canon III of the CPRA The CPRA provides that a lawyer must observe fidelity in all his dealings. Under Canon III of the CPRA, fidelity ""pertains to a lawyer's duty to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the land, to assist in the administration of justice as an officer of the court, and to advance or defend a client's cause, with full devotion, genuine interest, and zeal in the pursuit of truth and justice."" This duty of a lawyer is further clarified in Section 2 thereof, to wit:Section 2. The responsible and accountable lawyer. â A lawyer shall uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of the land, promote respect for laws and legal processes, safeguard human rights, and at all times advance the honor and integrity of the legal profession.As an officer of the court, a lawyer shall uphold the rule of law and conscientiously assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice.As an advocate, a lawyer shall represent the client with fidelity and zeal within the bounds of the law and the CPRA.From the foregoing, the fidelity expected of a lawyer does not mean unbridled loyalty to their client's cause. Far from it, fidelity pertains to a lawyer's faithfulness to the rule of law. Thus, in advocating for their client's interests, a lawyer must always observe the law and legal processes. They must never give inappropriate or illegal advice or pursue an illicit course of action. On the contrary, they must consistently conduct themselves in a manner that upholds and reinforces the rule of law and the efficient administration of justice. After all, as aptly put by the Court in Jimenez v. Verano, Jr.,[24] ""[t]he primary duty of lawyers is not to their clients but to the administration of justice. To that end, their clients' success is wholly subordinate.""[25]Here, Atty. Tecson miserably failed to live up to his duty to uphold the rule of law and to assist in the efficient administration of justice. Instead of advising his clients to go through the regular process of execution, he deliberately chose to cut short and undermine such legal process by advising his clients to bribe. What is more shocking to the Court is Atty. Tecson's unabashed admission of his role in the bribery. He readily admitted that he suggested to engage a PR man without any showing of remorse or intimation that he was at least aware of the wrongfulness of his action.An integral part of a lawyer's duty of fidelity is their duty to account for their client's properties during and after the lawyer-client relationship. During the existence of the lawyer-client relationship, Canon III, Section 49 of the CPRA defines the nature and extent of this duty as follows, to wit:Section 49. Accounting during engagement. â A lawyer, during the existence of the lawyer-client relationship, shall account for and prepare an inventory of any fund or property belonging to the client, whether received from the latter or from a third person, immediately upon such receipt.When funds are entrusted to a lawyer by a client for a specific purpose, the lawyer shall use such funds only for the client's declared purpose. Any unused amount of the entrusted funds shall be promptly returned to the client upon accomplishment of the stated purpose or the client's demand.Unlike in Rule 16.01 of the CPR which simply states that a lawyer must account for all money or property collected or received for or from a client, the CPRA now clearly defines the nature and extent of this duty, both during the existence of the lawyer-client relationship and after its termination.As provided above, the lawyer's duty to account during engagement commences immediately upon their receipt of the fund or property belonging to the client. This duty includes the following, to wit: (a) preparing an inventory for said fund or property, (b) using the same for the stated purpose, and (c) promptly returning the unused portion thereof to the client upon demand or upon the accomplishment of the stated purpose. Of course, when the lawyer claims to have spent or utilized the client's money or property for the stated purpose, it is incumbent upon them to show proof thereof.Here, Atty. Tecson admitted having received from the RTC, on behalf of Lizada et al., the total amount of PHP 134,341,965.15. However, only half thereof, or PHP 67,170,982.57, was accounted for. The amount of PHP 67,170,982.57 was not returned to Lizada et al. as the same was purportedly given as payment to the PR man. With these established facts, the question that the Court now resolves is whether Atty. Tecson, as part of his duty to account, has the obligation to return to Lizada et al. the amount of PHP 67,170,982.57.For the IC, Atty. Tecson must return said amount, albeit without a clear explanation why. The IC simply stated that such an obligation to return is based on his duty to account. The IBP Board, on the other hand, opined that Atty. Tecson has no obligation to return because said amount was purportedly given to the PR man with the conformity of Lizada et al. The Court cannot agree with the IBP Board's findings and recommendation.As previously stated, a lawyer's duty to account includes their duty to promptly give or return to the client the latter's fund or property upon the latter's demand, unless of course the lawyer has spent or utilized the same for the client's stated purpose. In Dizon v. Trinidad-Radoc,[26] the Court ruled that if the lawyer fails to return said fund or property upon demand, it is presumed that the lawyer misappropriated the same for their own use to the prejudice and in violation of the trust reposed in them by the client.[27]The Court finds that Lizada et al. demanded Atty. Tecson to remit to them the amount of PHP 67,170,982.57. For one, no litigant will simply let go of their hard-fought monetary award, especially when it is worth millions of pesos. Moreover, there is no indication from the records that Lizada et al. waived said unremitted amount or that they instructed Atty. Tecson to use or spend the same for a specified purpose. On the contrary, Lizada et al. clearly articulated their surprise when they received only half of what is due them, and their disappointment when they were told that their unremitted share will be given to Sen. De Lima in support of her senatorial bid. Parts of Lizada et al.'s verified Complaint read as follows, to wit:8. That unfortunately, however, when the check was encashed by Atty. Demosthenes Tecson on the said date (December 23, 2015) before the drawee bank (Land Bank of the Philippines, MEPZA Branch), thinking that we will be receiving in a pro indiviso share as per check issued by the PEZA in the name of Atty. Demosthenes Tecson, the latter only gave each of one us (sic) . . . the amount of only THIRTEEN MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX PESOS AND FIFTY ONE CENTAVOS ([PHP] 13,434,196.51) instead of TWENTY SIX MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE PESOS AND THREE CENTAVOS ([PHP] 26,868,393.03) Pesos, including the attorney's fee of Atty. Demosthenes Tecson;9. That we asked Atty. Demosthenes Tecson, why it is only PHP 13,434,196.51 representing our share ..., but Atty. Demosthenes Tecson told us he got also PHP 13,434,196.51 as his sixth (5th) (sic) share representing as his attorney's fee and that the fifty (50%) percent of the total amount of PHP 134,341,965.15 which is in the amount of PHP 67,170,982.575 shall be allotted to Department of Justice Secretary Laila Delima (sic).for she is running as a candidate for Senator this coming May 9, 2016 National Election[.][28] (Emphasis supplied)Since Lizada et al. demanded Atty. Tecson to return to them PHP 67,170,982.57, which represents the unremitted portion of their just compensation, the presumption that Atty. Tecson misappropriated the same for his benefit attaches. It is now incumbent upon Atty. Tecson to overcome such presumption by presenting evidence that he utilized the said amount for its intended purpose. Unfortunately, Atty. Tecson failed to do so. Atty. Tecson merely alleged, without anything to substantiate the same, that said amount was given to a PR man with the conformity of Lizada et al. Relevant parts of Atty. Tecson's Brief read as follows, to wit:13. On July 8, 2015[,] the respondent filed a motion for summary judgment which was subsequently followed with similar motion by Ms. Igot new counsel Atty. Santiago L. Ortiz, Jr., and apprehensive of another more waiting time with the pending intervention then represented by Atty. Manuel F. Ong that the respondent suggested to his clients to engage the services of a 3rd person as PR man to insure and expedite payment of their 14,162 sq. meter-patrimony to which complainants willingly agreed as long as the .former shall take care of pursuing it;14. After contracting a PR man who proposed that 50% out of PEZA/MEPZ payment would be the compensation for the services rendered that the respondent conferred with his clients who unanimously accepted the condition with some inquiries where the 50% of the PR man will go to which the respondent superficially opined that maybe some candidates will benefit therefrom as national election is forthcoming by May 14 the following year, and not to mind the disposition by the PR man of his 50% for the complainants could inevitably receive and enjoy their shares after 35 long years of battle in Court;....19. As soon as their turn came to get their share at about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of December 23, 2015, the respondent thru his newlyÂ­opened Savings Account No. 2431-0112-66 with the LBP MEZ, spontaneously signed withdrawal slips and turned over [PHP] 13,434,196.51 cash each to complainants Mamerta C. Lizada, in behalf of Hrs. of Rosalia C. Rivera, Enrique S. Cuizon, duly assisted by his daughter Ida Cuizon, Benito T. Cuizon, also assisted by his wife and Abelardo S. Cuizon who is assisted by his daughter. Thereafter, the respondent also turned over immediately the 50% due the PR man inside the Land Bank office equivalent to [PHP] 67,170,982.00 which were placed inside carton boxes and loaded into his car waiting near the door outside the LBP office and this fact was admitted by the complainants during their conference at Cebu City IBP Office.[29] (Emphasis supplied)To reiterate, the aforequoted assertions by Atty. Tecson have no accompanying proof. He merely alleged that Lizada et al. ""willingly agreed"" to his proposal to engage the services of a PR man, and ""unanimously accepted"" his proposal to use 50% of their just compensation to pay said PR man. Likewise, there is nothing in the records which supports Atty. Tecson's claim that Lizada et al. admitted during the conference at the Cebu City IBP Office that the PHP 67,170,982.57 was given to the PR man. Since Atty. Tecson failed to establish his allegations, the presumption that he misappropriated said amount remains unrebutted. Consequently, the Court finds that Atty. Tecson violated his duty to account and is thus liable to return to the Lizada et al. the full amount of PHP 67,170,982.57, with legal interest.Lest our discussions above be misinterpreted, the Court clarifies that even if Atty. Tecson was able to establish his allegations that the PHP 67,170,982.57 was indeed given to the PR man with the conformity of Lizada et al., he will still be found guilty of violating his duty to account and, consequently, he will still be directed to return said amount to Lizada et al.As previously stated, a lawyer's duty to account is an integral part of their duty of fidelity. We have also previously stated that a lawyer's duty of fidelity does not mean blind loyalty to their client's cause. Rather, fidelity means faithfulness to the rule of law. Based on these premises, a lawyer's duty to account, which includes their duty to spend or use the client's funds for its stated purpose, must necessarily align with their duty of fidelity. In other words, it is incumbent upon the lawyer, as part of their duty of fidelity, to spend or use their client's funds only for a lawful purpose.A lawyer, therefore, shall not advise their client to use the latter's funds or properties for an illicit purpose. In the same vein, a lawyer cannot just blindly obey their client's instructions on how the latter's funds or properties are to be utilized. Should the client instruct a lawyer to use or spend their funds for an illicit purpose, the lawyer has the legal duty to advise such client of the illegality of the latter's desired course of action, and the professional duty to propose a legal alternative. If the client insists on their instructions to use their funds for an illicit purpose, the lawyer is not without recourse. In such a situation, the lawyer may terminate the lawyer-client relationship.[30]Necessarily, if the lawyer advises their client to use the latter's funds for an illicit purpose, or if they accede to the client's instructions to use said funds for an illicit purpose, said lawyer violates their duty to account even if the client agrees to their advice or if said lawyer simply accedes to their client's instructions. Elsewise stated, if a lawyer uses their client's funds for an unlawful purpose, said lawyer cannot tenably invoke the defense that the client agreed to such use, or that said use is upon the client's instructions.A lawyer, therefore, has the responsibility to always ensure that the expenditure or utilization of the client's funds or properties is in accordance with law. If a lawyer fails to observe this duty, they must return to the client the latter's unlawfully spent funds upon the client's demand.The appropriate penaltyCanon VI, Section 33 of the CPRA expressly classifies the following offenses as serious, namely: (1) Gross misconduct, or any inexcusable, shameful or flagrant unlawful conduct; (2) Bribery or corruption; and (3) Misappropriating a client's funds or properties. Canon VI, Section 37 of the CPRA, on the other hand, provides that the penalty to be imposed on the respondent who is found guilty of a serious offense is any of the following or a combination thereof, to wit: (1) Disbarment; (2) Suspension from the practice of law for a period exceeding six (6) months; (3) Revocation of notarial commission and disqualification as a notary for not less than two (2) years; or (4) Fine exceeding PHP 100,000.00.As already discussed above, Atty. Tecson violated his duty to account by misappropriating a staggering amount of PHP 67,170,982.57 representing half of Lizada et al.'s just compensation. Worse, Atty. Tecson remorselessly admitted that he used the said amount to pay the services of a PR man to facilitate and expedite the payment of Lizada et al.'s just compensation. There is no doubt then that Atty. Tecson's infraction is a serious offense as contemplated under Canon VI, Section 33 of the CPRA because it constitutes gross misconduct and misappropriation of a client's funds or properties.Anent the penalty for Atty. Tecson's acts, the Court finds the penalty of disbarment appropriate.The Court's decision to impose upon Atty. Tecson the maximum penalty of disbarment is not without precedent. In similar cases where respondent lawyers misappropriated their clients' money or engaged in bribery or corruption, the Court imposed upon them the penalty of disbarment from the practice of law.In Freeman v. Atty. Reyes,[31] the Court disbarred the respondent lawyer who misappropriated the insurance proceeds of her client's deceased husband.In CF Sharp Crew Management, Inc. v. Torres,[32] the Court likewise disbarred the respondent lawyer who repeatedly requested the issuance of checks purportedly for settling seafarers' claims, only to have such checks deposited to an unauthorized bank account.In Bueno v. Atty. RaÃ±eses,[33] the Court disbarred a lawyer who, among others, solicited money from his client purportedly to bribe a judge in order to ensure a favorable judgment in favor of the client.In Rodco Consultancy and Maritime Services Corporation v. Atty. Concepcion,[34] the Court likewise disbarred a lawyer who solicited money from his client purportedly for the purpose of paying someone in the Court of Appeals to expedite and facilitate a favorable resolution in favor of his client. On top of this, the respondent lawyer failed to properly account the money he received from his client.Atty. Tecson's infraction is so egregious, exhibiting his moral depravity and complete disregard of his responsibilities as a member of the bar.Atty. Tecson is also directed to return to Lizada et al. the amount of PHP 67,170,982.57, with interest at the rate of 6% per annum, from the finality of this Decision until full payment.ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Atty. Demosthenes S. Tecson GUILTY of Gross Misconduct under Section 33(a) and misappropriating his clients' funds under Section 33(g) of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. He is DISBARRED and his name is to be STRICKEN OFF the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately.Atty. Demosthenes S. Tecson is also ORDERED to IMMEDIATELY RETURN to the complainants Marnerta C. Lizada, Benito Cuizon, Abelardo Cuizon, and Enrique Cuizon the amount of PHP 67,170,982.57, with interest of 6% per annum, reckoned from the date of finality of this Decision, until full payment. He is further DIRECTED to submit to this Court proof of payment within 10 days from said payment.Let copies of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant to l5e entered into the records of respondent Atty. Demosthenes S. Tecson. Copies shall likewise be furnished the (a) Integrated Bar of the Philippines, which shall disseminate copies thereof to all its Chapters; (b) all administrative and quasi-judicial agencies of the Republic of the Philippines; and (c) the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts concerned.SO ORDERED.

Demosthenes S. Tecson (Atty. Tecson) for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) due to his alleged failure to remit to the complainants Mamerta C. Lizada, Benito Cuizon, Abelardo Cuizon, and Enrique Cuizon (Lizada et al.) the total amount of PHP 67,170,982.57, representing half of the latter's just compensation.[2]Lizada et al. are the legal heirs of the late Spouses Leoncio Cuizon and Mamerta Seno (Spouses Cuizon).[3]Lizada et al. alleged that Spouses Cuizon were the registered owners of several parcels of land located in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu with a total area of 14,161.75 square meters.[4] On January 28, 1981, the Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZA)[5] sought the expropriation of said parcels of land for the development of an export processing zone in Lapu-Lapu City.[6] As such, Spouses Cuizon hired Atty. Tecson to represent them in the expropriation proceedings.[7]On September 24, 2015, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu rendered its Judgment, finding the expropriation proper, and fixing the just compensation at PHP 2,500.00 per square meter, with legal interest of 12% per annum from January 28, 1981 until full payment.[8] The computed amount of just compensation including accumulated interest is PHP 134,341,965.15, which amount was eventually paid by the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) on December 23, 2015.[9]The check representing the total just compensation was received by Atty. Tecson who, in turn, remitted the amount of PHP 13,434,196.51 to each of the complainants, or a total of PHP 53,736,786.04.[10] Notably, Lizada et al. expected to receive PHP 26,868,393.03 each and were thus surprised when they received only half of the said amount.[11]The remaining PHP 13,434,196.51, which is equal to each individual share of Lizada et al., was kept by Atty. Tecson as his attorney's fees.[12] With respect to the remaining PHP 67,170,982.57, Atty. Tecson simply told Lizada et al. that the same will be allotted to former Department of Justice Secretary Leila De Lima in support of her senatorial bid.[13]In his Brief,[14] Atty. Tecson admitted that he was engaged by the estate administrator of Spouses Cuizon as their counsel in the expropriation proceedings brought against them.[15] Atty. Tecson likewise admitted that he suggested to Lizada et al. the engagement of a ""PR"" man to ensure and expedite the payment of their just compensation.[16] Furthermore, Atty. Tecson admitted that he received the PHP 134,341,965.15 just compensation and remitted only PHP 13,434,196.51 each to Lizada et al. Lastly, he admitted that he kept PHP 13,434,196.51 as his legal fees, and that the PHP 67,170,982.00 was given to the PR man responsible for the expeditious payment by PEZA of Lizada et al.'s just compensation.[17]In his defense, Atty. Tecson averred that the engagement of the PR man was with the conformity of Lizada et al.[18]Findings and Recommendations of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP)The IBP Investigating Commissioner (IC)[19] found that Atty. Tecson violated Canon III of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA).[20] Accordingly, Atty. Tecson's admission that he advised Lizada et al. to hire a PR man and that he personally handed the supposed ""share"" or ""facilitation fee"" to the PR man is a clear proof of his violation of his duty of fidelity. In addition, the IC found that Atty. Tecson violated his fiduciary duty to account for the money belonging to Lizada et al. by failing to return half of the latter's just compensation. Finally, the IC noted that Atty. Tecson failed to timely file his verified answer and position paper. For the IC, this further shows Atty. Tecson's deliberate failure to respect the law and the tribunal.[21]Based on the above findings, the IC recommended that Atty. Tecson be disbarred, and that he be ordered to return the amount of PHP 67,170,982.57 to Lizada et al. with 6% interest per annum until fully paid.[22]In a Resolution dated January 13, 2024, the IBP Board of Governors (IBP Board) resolved to approve and adopt the Report and Recommendation of the IC to impose the penalty of disbarment upon Atty. Tecson. However, the IBP Board disapproved the recommendation of the IC that Atty. Tecson be likewise obliged to return the sum of PHP 67,170,982.57. Accordingly, Lizada et al. knew that said amount was given to a third party as payment of the latter's services.[23]The Court's RulingThe Court adopts the findings and approves the recommendation of the IBP Board to disbar Atty. Tecson. However, the Court finds that Atty. Tecson should likewise be ordered to return to Lizada et al. the sum of PHP 67,170,982.57, with legal interest.Applicability of the CPRAThe verified Complaint for disbarment was instituted against Atty. Tecson before the effectivity of the CPRA. This notwithstanding, the propriety of Atty. Tecson's conduct shall be determined applying the CPRA pursuant to the CPRA's transitory provision which states:Section 1. Transitory provision. â The CPRA shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except to the extent that in the opinion of the Supreme Court, its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern.Since it does not appear to the Court that the retroactive application of the CPRA is not feasible or would work injustice to any of the parties, the Court shall resolve this case applying the provisions of the CPRA. Atty. Tecson failed to observe and live up to his duty of fidelity under Canon III of the CPRA The CPRA provides that a lawyer must observe fidelity in all his dealings. Under Canon III of the CPRA, fidelity ""pertains to a lawyer's duty to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the land, to assist in the administration of justice as an officer of the court, and to advance or defend a client's cause, with full devotion, genuine interest, and zeal in the pursuit of truth and justice."" This duty of a lawyer is further clarified in Section 2 thereof, to wit:Section 2. The responsible and accountable lawyer. â A lawyer shall uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of the land, promote respect for laws and legal processes, safeguard human rights, and at all times advance the honor and integrity of the legal profession.As an officer of the court, a lawyer shall uphold the rule of law and conscientiously assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice.As an advocate, a lawyer shall represent the client with fidelity and zeal within the bounds of the law and the CPRA.From the foregoing, the fidelity expected of a lawyer does not mean unbridled loyalty to their client's cause. Far from it, fidelity pertains to a lawyer's faithfulness to the rule of law. Thus, in advocating for their client's interests, a lawyer must always observe the law and legal processes. They must never give inappropriate or illegal advice or pursue an illicit course of action. On the contrary, they must consistently conduct themselves in a manner that upholds and reinforces the rule of law and the efficient administration of justice. After all, as aptly put by the Court in Jimenez v. Verano, Jr.,[24] ""[t]he primary duty of lawyers is not to their clients but to the administration of justice. To that end, their clients' success is wholly subordinate.""[25]Here, Atty. Tecson miserably failed to live up to his duty to uphold the rule of law and to assist in the efficient administration of justice. Instead of advising his clients to go through the regular process of execution, he deliberately chose to cut short and undermine such legal process by advising his clients to bribe. What is more shocking to the Court is Atty. Tecson's unabashed admission of his role in the bribery. He readily admitted that he suggested to engage a PR man without any showing of remorse or intimation that he was at least aware of the wrongfulness of his action.An integral part of a lawyer's duty of fidelity is their duty to account for their client's properties during and after the lawyer-client relationship. During the existence of the lawyer-client relationship, Canon III, Section 49 of the CPRA defines the nature and extent of this duty as follows, to wit:Section 49. Accounting during engagement. â A lawyer, during the existence of the lawyer-client relationship, shall account for and prepare an inventory of any fund or property belonging to the client, whether received from the latter or from a third person, immediately upon such receipt.When funds are entrusted to a lawyer by a client for a specific purpose, the lawyer shall use such funds only for the client's declared purpose. Any unused amount of the entrusted funds shall be promptly returned to the client upon accomplishment of the stated purpose or the client's demand.Unlike in Rule 16.01 of the CPR which simply states that a lawyer must account for all money or property collected or received for or from a client, the CPRA now clearly defines the nature and extent of this duty, both during the existence of the lawyer-client relationship and after its termination.As provided above, the lawyer's duty to account during engagement commences immediately upon their receipt of the fund or property belonging to the client. This duty includes the following, to wit: (a) preparing an inventory for said fund or property, (b) using the same for the stated purpose, and (c) promptly returning the unused portion thereof to the client upon demand or upon the accomplishment of the stated purpose. Of course, when the lawyer claims to have spent or utilized the client's money or property for the stated purpose, it is incumbent upon them to show proof thereof.Here, Atty. Tecson admitted having received from the RTC, on behalf of Lizada et al., the total amount of PHP 134,341,965.15. However, only half thereof, or PHP 67,170,982.57, was accounted for. The amount of PHP 67,170,982.57 was not returned to Lizada et al. as the same was purportedly given as payment to the PR man. With these established facts, the question that the Court now resolves is whether Atty. Tecson, as part of his duty to account, has the obligation to return to Lizada et al. the amount of PHP 67,170,982.57.For the IC, Atty. Tecson must return said amount, albeit without a clear explanation why. The IC simply stated that such an obligation to return is based on his duty to account. The IBP Board, on the other hand, opined that Atty. Tecson has no obligation to return because said amount was purportedly given to the PR man with the conformity of Lizada et al. The Court cannot agree with the IBP Board's findings and recommendation.As previously stated, a lawyer's duty to account includes their duty to promptly give or return to the client the latter's fund or property upon the latter's demand, unless of course the lawyer has spent or utilized the same for the client's stated purpose. In Dizon v. Trinidad-Radoc,[26] the Court ruled that if the lawyer fails to return said fund or property upon demand, it is presumed that the lawyer misappropriated the same for their own use to the prejudice and in violation of the trust reposed in them by the client.[27]The Court finds that Lizada et al. demanded Atty. Tecson to remit to them the amount of PHP 67,170,982.57. For one, no litigant will simply let go of their hard-fought monetary award, especially when it is worth millions of pesos. Moreover, there is no indication from the records that Lizada et al. waived said unremitted amount or that they instructed Atty. Tecson to use or spend the same for a specified purpose. On the contrary, Lizada et al. clearly articulated their surprise when they received only half of what is due them, and their disappointment when they were told that their unremitted share will be given to Sen. De Lima in support of her senatorial bid. Parts of Lizada et al.'s verified Complaint read as follows, to wit:8. That unfortunately, however, when the check was encashed by Atty. Demosthenes Tecson on the said date (December 23, 2015) before the drawee bank (Land Bank of the Philippines, MEPZA Branch), thinking that we will be receiving in a pro indiviso share as per check issued by the PEZA in the name of Atty. Demosthenes Tecson, the latter only gave each of one us (sic) . . . the amount of only THIRTEEN MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX PESOS AND FIFTY ONE CENTAVOS ([PHP] 13,434,196.51) instead of TWENTY SIX MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE PESOS AND THREE CENTAVOS ([PHP] 26,868,393.03) Pesos, including the attorney's fee of Atty. Demosthenes Tecson;9. That we asked Atty. Demosthenes Tecson, why it is only PHP 13,434,196.51 representing our share ..., but Atty. Demosthenes Tecson told us he got also PHP 13,434,196.51 as his sixth (5th) (sic) share representing as his attorney's fee and that the fifty (50%) percent of the total amount of PHP 134,341,965.15 which is in the amount of PHP 67,170,982.575 shall be allotted to Department of Justice Secretary Laila Delima (sic).for she is running as a candidate for Senator this coming May 9, 2016 National Election[.][28] (Emphasis supplied)Since Lizada et al. demanded Atty. Tecson to return to them PHP 67,170,982.57, which represents the unremitted portion of their just compensation, the presumption that Atty. Tecson misappropriated the same for his benefit attaches. It is now incumbent upon Atty. Tecson to overcome such presumption by presenting evidence that he utilized the said amount for its intended purpose. Unfortunately, Atty. Tecson failed to do so. Atty. Tecson merely alleged, without anything to substantiate the same, that said amount was given to a PR man with the conformity of Lizada et al. Relevant parts of Atty. Tecson's Brief read as follows, to wit:13. On July 8, 2015[,] the respondent filed a motion for summary judgment which was subsequently followed with similar motion by Ms. Igot new counsel Atty. Santiago L. Ortiz, Jr., and apprehensive of another more waiting time with the pending intervention then represented by Atty. Manuel F. Ong that the respondent suggested to his clients to engage the services of a 3rd person as PR man to insure and expedite payment of their 14,162 sq. meter-patrimony to which complainants willingly agreed as long as the .former shall take care of pursuing it;14. After contracting a PR man who proposed that 50% out of PEZA/MEPZ payment would be the compensation for the services rendered that the respondent conferred with his clients who unanimously accepted the condition with some inquiries where the 50% of the PR man will go to which the respondent superficially opined that maybe some candidates will benefit therefrom as national election is forthcoming by May 14 the following year, and not to mind the disposition by the PR man of his 50% for the complainants could inevitably receive and enjoy their shares after 35 long years of battle in Court;....19. As soon as their turn came to get their share at about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of December 23, 2015, the respondent thru his newlyÂ­opened Savings Account No. 2431-0112-66 with the LBP MEZ, spontaneously signed withdrawal slips and turned over [PHP] 13,434,196.51 cash each to complainants Mamerta C. Lizada, in behalf of Hrs. of Rosalia C. Rivera, Enrique S. Cuizon, duly assisted by his daughter Ida Cuizon, Benito T. Cuizon, also assisted by his wife and Abelardo S. Cuizon who is assisted by his daughter. Thereafter, the respondent also turned over immediately the 50% due the PR man inside the Land Bank office equivalent to [PHP] 67,170,982.00 which were placed inside carton boxes and loaded into his car waiting near the door outside the LBP office and this fact was admitted by the complainants during their conference at Cebu City IBP Office.[29] (Emphasis supplied)To reiterate, the aforequoted assertions by Atty. Tecson have no accompanying proof. He merely alleged that Lizada et al. ""willingly agreed"" to his proposal to engage the services of a PR man, and ""unanimously accepted"" his proposal to use 50% of their just compensation to pay said PR man. Likewise, there is nothing in the records which supports Atty. Tecson's claim that Lizada et al. admitted during the conference at the Cebu City IBP Office that the PHP 67,170,982.57 was given to the PR man. Since Atty. Tecson failed to establish his allegations, the presumption that he misappropriated said amount remains unrebutted. Consequently, the Court finds that Atty. Tecson violated his duty to account and is thus liable to return to the Lizada et al. the full amount of PHP 67,170,982.57, with legal interest.Lest our discussions above be misinterpreted, the Court clarifies that even if Atty. Tecson was able to establish his allegations that the PHP 67,170,982.57 was indeed given to the PR man with the conformity of Lizada et al., he will still be found guilty of violating his duty to account and, consequently, he will still be directed to return said amount to Lizada et al.As previously stated, a lawyer's duty to account is an integral part of their duty of fidelity. We have also previously stated that a lawyer's duty of fidelity does not mean blind loyalty to their client's cause. Rather, fidelity means faithfulness to the rule of law. Based on these premises, a lawyer's duty to account, which includes their duty to spend or use the client's funds for its stated purpose, must necessarily align with their duty of fidelity. In other words, it is incumbent upon the lawyer, as part of their duty of fidelity, to spend or use their client's funds only for a lawful purpose.A lawyer, therefore, shall not advise their client to use the latter's funds or properties for an illicit purpose. In the same vein, a lawyer cannot just blindly obey their client's instructions on how the latter's funds or properties are to be utilized. Should the client instruct a lawyer to use or spend their funds for an illicit purpose, the lawyer has the legal duty to advise such client of the illegality of the latter's desired course of action, and the professional duty to propose a legal alternative. If the client insists on their instructions to use their funds for an illicit purpose, the lawyer is not without recourse. In such a situation, the lawyer may terminate the lawyer-client relationship.[30]Necessarily, if the lawyer advises their client to use the latter's funds for an illicit purpose, or if they accede to the client's instructions to use said funds for an illicit purpose, said lawyer violates their duty to account even if the client agrees to their advice or if said lawyer simply accedes to their client's instructions. Elsewise stated, if a lawyer uses their client's funds for an unlawful purpose, said lawyer cannot tenably invoke the defense that the client agreed to such use, or that said use is upon the client's instructions.A lawyer, therefore, has the responsibility to always ensure that the expenditure or utilization of the client's funds or properties is in accordance with law. If a lawyer fails to observe this duty, they must return to the client the latter's unlawfully spent funds upon the client's demand.The appropriate penaltyCanon VI, Section 33 of the CPRA expressly classifies the following offenses as serious, namely: (1) Gross misconduct, or any inexcusable, shameful or flagrant unlawful conduct; (2) Bribery or corruption; and (3) Misappropriating a client's funds or properties. Canon VI, Section 37 of the CPRA, on the other hand, provides that the penalty to be imposed on the respondent who is found guilty of a serious offense is any of the following or a combination thereof, to wit: (1) Disbarment; (2) Suspension from the practice of law for a period exceeding six (6) months; (3) Revocation of notarial commission and disqualification as a notary for not less than two (2) years; or (4) Fine exceeding PHP 100,000.00.As already discussed above, Atty. Tecson violated his duty to account by misappropriating a staggering amount of PHP 67,170,982.57 representing half of Lizada et al.'s just compensation. Worse, Atty. Tecson remorselessly admitted that he used the said amount to pay the services of a PR man to facilitate and expedite the payment of Lizada et al.'s just compensation. There is no doubt then that Atty. Tecson's infraction is a serious offense as contemplated under Canon VI, Section 33 of the CPRA because it constitutes gross misconduct and misappropriation of a client's funds or properties.Anent the penalty for Atty. Tecson's acts, the Court finds the penalty of disbarment appropriate.The Court's decision to impose upon Atty. Tecson the maximum penalty of disbarment is not without precedent. In similar cases where respondent lawyers misappropriated their clients' money or engaged in bribery or corruption, the Court imposed upon them the penalty of disbarment from the practice of law.In Freeman v. Atty. Reyes,[31] the Court disbarred the respondent lawyer who misappropriated the insurance proceeds of her client's deceased husband.In CF Sharp Crew Management, Inc. v. Torres,[32] the Court likewise disbarred the respondent lawyer who repeatedly requested the issuance of checks purportedly for settling seafarers' claims, only to have such checks deposited to an unauthorized bank account.In Bueno v. Atty. RaÃ±eses,[33] the Court disbarred a lawyer who, among others, solicited money from his client purportedly to bribe a judge in order to ensure a favorable judgment in favor of the client.In Rodco Consultancy and Maritime Services Corporation v. Atty. Concepcion,[34] the Court likewise disbarred a lawyer who solicited money from his client purportedly for the purpose of paying someone in the Court of Appeals to expedite and facilitate a favorable resolution in favor of his client. On top of this, the respondent lawyer failed to properly account the money he received from his client.Atty. Tecson's infraction is so egregious, exhibiting his moral depravity and complete disregard of his responsibilities as a member of the bar.Atty. Tecson is also directed to return to Lizada et al. the amount of PHP 67,170,982.57, with interest at the rate of 6% per annum, from the finality of this Decision until full payment.ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Atty. Demosthenes S. Tecson GUILTY of Gross Misconduct under Section 33(a) and misappropriating his clients' funds under Section 33(g) of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. He is DISBARRED and his name is to be STRICKEN OFF the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately.Atty. Demosthenes S. Tecson is also ORDERED to IMMEDIATELY RETURN to the complainants Marnerta C. Lizada, Benito Cuizon, Abelardo Cuizon, and Enrique Cuizon the amount of PHP 67,170,982.57, with interest of 6% per annum, reckoned from the date of finality of this Decision, until full payment. He is further DIRECTED to submit to this Court proof of payment within 10 days from said payment.Let copies of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant to l5e entered into the records of respondent Atty. Demosthenes S. Tecson. Copies shall likewise be furnished the (a) Integrated Bar of the Philippines, which shall disseminate copies thereof to all its Chapters; (b) all administrative and quasi-judicial agencies of the Republic of the Philippines; and (c) the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts concerned.SO ORDERED.

No. 255706 ROWENA MANLUTAC GREEN, PETITIONER, VS. JEFFERY A. GREEN AND THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS. February 17, 2025","Unlike ordinary witnesses who must have personal knowledge of the matters they testify on, expert witnesses do not testify in court because they have personal knowledge of the facts of the case. The credibility of expert witnesses does not inhere in their person; rather, their testimony is sought because of their special knowledge, skill, experience, or training that ordinary persons and judges do not have.[52] (Citations omitted)","This Petition for Review on Certiorari[2] assails the June 30, 2020 Decision[3] and January 29, 2021 Resolution[4] of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the June 5, 2017 Decision[5] of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, declaring the marriage between Rowena Manlutac-Green (Rowena) and Jeffery A. Green (Jeffery)[6] as void ab initio on the ground of Rowena's psychological incapacity. Sometime in 2006, Jeffery, a United States Navy retiree, met Rowena in a bar owned by Rowena's mother in Angeles City, Pampanga.[7] Their friendship at the start later developed into a steady dating relationship.[8] At that time, Jeffery knew Rowena had two children from a previous relationship, and Rowena knew Jeffery was married to another, but that his divorce was still pending.[9] On August 22, 2008, Rowena gave birth to her third child, Abigail.[10] Jeffery then acknowledged paternity of Abigail.[11] On May 8, 2010, Jeffery and Rowena got married at St. Ignatius de Loyola Cathedral in Quezon City.[12] After getting married, Jeffery stayed and worked in Makati City, while Rowena stayed with him three to four days a week and then returned to her children in Angeles City for the remaining days.[13] On July 7, 2014, Jeffery filed a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage[14] with Rowena before the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, on the basis of both parties' psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code. Aside from documentary evidence proving Rowena's infidelity, lies, and debts, Jeffery attached a Psychiatric Evaluation Report made by Dr. Ma. Bernadette Manalo-Arcena (Dr. Manalo-Arcena) after conducting interviews with Jeffery, Rowena, Rowena's mother, and the spouses' mutual friend. The Psychiatric Evaluation Report summarize factual bases for Jeffery's filing of the petition: Rowena had more or else [sic] sustained debts worth [PHP] 4 million[]DNA Test revealed that Jeffery Green is not the father of her daughter Abigail as she claimed however he accepted her as my [sic] own childJeffery Green saw pictures of his wife with another man hugging[,] holding hands and very close together Lies with money relationship and activities The house which he believed he invested was gone into waste as Rowena mishandled the money for the house Rowena had 3 abortions and he found out she was using abortifacient medications Dishonesty[,] lying[,] cheating and verbal abuseNumerous debts and with pathological gamblingFalsification of their title of the house which he believed initially they owned and paid for but Rowena squandered his money.[15] The Office of the Solicitor General entered its appearance for the Republic of the Philippines and manifested that it authorized the Office of the City Prosecutor of Makati City to appear on its behalf.[16] On November 29, 2014, Rowena was duly served with summons, but she did not file an answer.[17] Upon the Regional Trial Court's directive, the Office of the City Prosecutor submitted a Manifestation stating that he found no evidence of collusion between the parties.[18] On June 16, 2015, the preÂ­ trial conference was terminated without Rowena filing a pre-trial brief.[19] In a June 5, 2017 Decision,[20] the Regional Trial Court granted Jeffery's Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage and ordered the Local Civil Registrars of Makati City and Quezon City to record the Decision and cancel the marriage of the parties in their respective Books of Marriages. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:","In ruling that the marriage is void due to psychological incapacity, the Court in Georfo gave due weight and consideration to the psychological assessment derived on sources other than the petitioning spouses: Here, Dr. Gerong's psychological assessment is not only based on petitioner, but also on another source: petitioner's sister. This circumstance is more akin with Tan-Andal, where this Court gave credence to the psychological assessment based on the interview of the petitioning spouse, her sister, and daughter. It is essential to have the psychological assessment derived from sources other than the petitioning spouse because of the obvious bias in favor of the petitioner's cause. This dilemma is avoided when another person supports the petitioner's testimony, even if the supporting testimony comes from the petitioning spouse's friend or relative. This is a realistic reception of psychological assessments considering that the friends or relatives of the alleged psychologically incapacitated spouse will not be inclined to give hostile testimonies against the latter. Thus, psychological assessments based on testimonies of petitioner and her sister may be given credence, unless there are reasons to believe that the testimonies are fabricated to favor the petitioner. As long as the totality of the evidence establishes the private respondent's psychological incapacity, the dissolution of the marriage is warranted.[53] (Citations omitted) Datu v. Datu[54] reiterated Tan-Andal and held a person psychologically incapacitated to comply with his essential marital obligations when his psychosis was an enduring part of his personality structure, leading him to do clear acts of dysfunctionality undermining his spouse and their family: Here, this Court finds that Alfredo is psychologically incapacitated to comply with his essential marital obligations, not because he suffers from schizophrenia per se, but because his psychosis has been found to be an enduring part of his personality structure. This psychosis, in tum, led him to do clear acts of dysfunctionality that undermined Irene and their family. As the lower courts found, Alfredo believes himself to be the son of God. In his mind, his refusal to live with Irene and to provide for the family was God's will. He also believes that he can have as many wives as he wants, which is not only illegal but is in utter disrespect and disregard of his marital vow to Irene. His incapacity is grave, not a ""mild characteriological peculiarity,"" a ""mood change,"" or an ""occasional emotional outburst""; his psychosis was grave enough for him to be discharged from military service.[55] Similarly here, the totality of the evidence presented proved petitioner's psychological incapacity to comply with her marital obligations. Respondent discharged the burden of proof to establish the psychological incapacity with clear and convincing evidence. Aside from the Psychiatric Evaluation Report by Dr. Manalo-Arcena, respondent attached documentary evidence such as copies of collection cases filed against petitioner, the DNA test result on Abigail's paternity, and pictures of petitioner hugging and holding hands with another man,[56] in order to prove his allegation of petitioner's infidelity, lies, and debts. The Psychiatric Evaluation Report of the parties is further given probative value, since it was offered in evidence and the psychologist conducted a series of standard tests and interviewed petitioner, respondent, petitioner's mother, and the spouses' mutual friend. According to Dr. Manalo-Arcena, petitioner's personality structure of Borderline Personality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder are characterized and manifested in her ""frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, having unstable relationships with her own mother and the petitioner, unstable self-image, impulsivity, affective instability and difficulty in controlling anger.""[57] As further found by the trial court: For the Borderline Personality Disorder, the psychiatrist identified the [Rowena]'s trait as follows: Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment Having unstable relationship with her mother and with the [Jeffery] Unstable self-imageImpulsivityAffective instability []Difficulty in controlling anger On the Antisocial Personality Disorder of [Rowena], Dr. Arcena listed the following symptoms: Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds of arrest Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases or conning others for personal profit or pleasure Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead Irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeatedly physical fights or assaults Reckless disregard for the safety of self or othersConsistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations Lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt, mistreated or stolen from another. Borderline Personality Disorder is a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity. Meanwhile, antisocial personality disorder is a condition characterized by repetitive behavioral patterns that are contrary to usual moral and ethical standards and cause a person to experience continuous conflict with society. It was apparent that [Rowena] is impulsive and irresponsible. She was already hooked on gambling even before she married [Jeffery]. [Rowena] had shown disregard to her obligations and commitments. Despite the monetary support given to her by [Jeffery], [Rowena] defaulted in the payment of her debts and monthly amortizations for her car. She is scheming and deceitful. She manipulated [Jeffery] in giving her money for the purchase of the house and lot in Angeles City. She tricked him by showing a spurious Transfer Certificate of Title No. 90148 allegedly registered under her name. She fooled [Jeffery] in believing that Abigail Manlutac Green is his daughter. However, the DNA test results conducted proved otherwise. She lied as to the true identity of the biological father of Abigail. [Rowena] has unstable interpersonal relationships. Despite her relationship with [Jeffery], she flaunted her affair with another man, whom she introduced as her cousin to [Jeffery]. Said relationship with the same man even carried on after the parties got married. Her involvement with several men before and after the marriage is an indication of her reckless behavior, disregarding or compromising her own and her husband's health and safety. The string of criminal and civil cases that [Rowena] [is] facing now are indications of having failed to conform to social norms. She conned her husband by providing spurious documents, repeatedly lied to her husband about money and fooled her husband for carrying extramarital affairs. [Rowena] did all of these things for money, for her personal gain and pleasure. Her impulsivity or failure to plan ahead has shown when she agreed to live with [Jeffery] without the benefit of marriage and after they got married, she refuses to live with her husband by using her children as her excuse. In the first place, when she got married to [Jeffery], her marital obligations began. She did not prepare or tell her children that she needs to live with her husband. [Rowena] is irritable and aggressive. She is demanding and always asked for money from [Jeffery]. When her wants and demands are not met, she becomes angry and demeaned [Jeffery]. She texted boisterous messages and verbally abused [Jeffery] by threatening to report him to the Embassy for not supporting her. She lacks empathy and remorse that she disregarded the feelings of her husband as long as she could get what she wants. Although she feared that her husband would abandon her for her misdeeds, she has no guilt feelings. She lacks remorse for what she has done as she continues her gambling in casinos and contracting loans even if she has no money to pay for them and her affair with men. Her string of court cases involving money showed her continuous failure to settle her obligations in spite of the monetary support extended to her by the petitioner. Instead of owning her misdeeds, she faulted her husband for all the misery that she is encountering. Dr. Arcena attributed the Borderline Personality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder falling into category of Personality Disorders Not Otherwise Specified of [Rowena] from problems of trust that existed at the early age (15 years old) and poor parental model figures.[58] The Psychiatric Evaluation Report further establishes the gravity, incurability, root cause, and permanence of the parties' personality structures. According to Dr. Manalo-Arcena, petitioner's personality structure is a product of problems of trust that existed during the early stages of childhood and her poor parental model figures.[59] Her personality structure is found to be continuing and incurable considering that ""the obligations to live together provide love, give respect, loyalty and fidelity among each other were longer existent in their marriage.""[60] Furthermore, as noted by Dr. Manalo-Arcena, petitioner's personality with Borderline Personality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder makes it difficult for her to assume essential marital obligations with respondent. Her unstable interpersonal relationship, self-image and emotions, impulsivity, deceitfulness, consistent irresponsibility, and lack of remorse resulted to ""[her refusal] to live with Jeffery, they have no fixed family domicile, she lied about Abigail's paternity, she was a gambler and a spendthrift but was entirely dependent on Jeffery's support, and she made one lie after another and got deeper and deeper in debt, resulting in civil and criminal cases.""[61] All told, since petitioner has grave and incurable psychological incapacity, consisting of her personality structure rooted from her childhood and manifested during marriage, her marriage with respondent is declare null and void.

"A.C. No. 13361 [Formerly CBD Case No. 17-5314] - HENRY G. LACIDA, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. REJOICE S. SUBEJANO, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N - Supreme Court E-Library","A.C. No. 13361 [Formerly CBD Case No. 17-5314] HENRY G. LACIDA, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. REJOICE S. SUBEJANO, RESPONDENT. February 12, 2025",,,"This resolves the complaint[1] for disbarment filed by complainant Henry G. Lacida (complainant) on behalf of Megamitch Financial Resources Corporation (Megamitch) against respondent Atty. Rejoice S. Subejano (respondent) in connection with a loan obtained by respondent from Megamitch.On January 19, 2015, respondent and Mr. Alejandro Rentillosa (Rentillosa) applied for a loan amounting to PHP 15,000,000.00 with Megamitch to augment the capitalization of their aggregate business in Iligan City and Lanao del Norte.[2] At that time, Subejano & Ditucalan (SD Law), of which respondent is a founding partner, was Megamitch's retained legal counsel.[3] In securing the loan, respondent allegedly took advantage of his personal relationship with Megamitch's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Alain De Schouwer (De Schouwer), and misrepresented that he and Mr. Rentillosa were engaged in the sand and gravel business in Iligan City and Lanao del Norte.[4]Thus, on different dates in January 2015, De Schouwer authorized the release of funds totaling to PHP 11,679,900.00 to respondent, under a purported agreement that respondent would later execute a loan contract and provide the necessary security as required under Megamitch's loan application procedure.[5]Subsequently, respondent submitted a Loan Contract with Chattel Mortgage to Megamitch, which was, however, deemed unacceptable by Megamitch.[6] Megamitch also allegedly discovered from the Office of the Treasurer of Iligan City that respondent had no business record with the city, contrary to his representations.[7] As a result, Megamitch refused to release the balance of the approved loan and demanded the return of the amounts already released to respondent.[8] When respondent failed to heed these demands, Megamitch filed a criminal case for Estafa against respondent and Rentillosa, as well as the present disbarment case against respondent.[9]For his part, respondent admitted that he obtained a loan from Megamitch for their business venture.[10] He also added that he had previously obtained a loan amounting to PHP 500,000.00 from Megamitch, which he fully repaid in December 2016.[11] As regards the subject loan transaction, respondent denied making any misrepresentations or using deceit to secure the approval of their loan application.[12] He asserted that, as part of the loan application process, he and Rentillosa submitted a business proposal and feasibility study, which were evaluated by Megamitch's officers.[13] Respondent also stated that the proceeds of the loan were used to purchase heavy equipment, which were inspected by Megamitch's officers, and that he promptly submitted the proof of purchase to Megamitch.[14]Respondent also alleged that he already made several payments to Megamitch but was unable to fully comply with the loan agreement because their business venture failed due to the unfavorable political climate in Iliga City.[15] Nevertheless, respondent maintained that he is not evading his obligations and is doing all in his capacity to repay Megamitch.[16]In her Report and Recommendation[17] dated August 15, 2018, Investigating Commissioner Rebecca Villanueva-Maala (Comm. Maala) found respondent guilty of violating Canon 16, Rule 16.04 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), which states that: ""A lawyer shall not borrow from his client unless the client's interests are fully protected by the nature of the case or by independent advice."" This finding was based on respondent's admission that he contracted a loan from his client, Megamitch, at the time when he was its retained legal counsel. Accordingly, Comm. Maala recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for five years.In a Resolution[18] dated June 17, 2019, the IBP Board of Governors (IBP-BOG) adopted the findings of the Comm. Maala but reduced the recommended penalty to six months suspension from the practice of law.Aggrieved, respondent filed a Motion for Reconsideration[19] (MR), arguing that: (a) he was not the legal counsel of Megamitch as it was SD Law; (b) he incurred the loan in his personal capacity, and the loan has nothing to do with any of the cases handled by SD Law for Megamitch; (c) he did not take undue advantage of or deceive Megamitch to secure the loan; and (d) Megamitch's interests were duly protected by the independent advice of its officers and employees, as well as by postdated checks issued by Rentillosa. Respondent also subsequently filed a Supplemental MR,[20] to which he attached a copy of the Compromise Agreement[21] dated February 8, 2020 executed by De Schouwer and himself, which was submitted to the trial court for the provisional dismissal of the Estafa case.Complainant raised no objection to respondent's MR and Supplemental MR, and even prayed that respondent not be penalized so that he could comply with the Compromise Agreement.[22] Nonetheless, complainant prayed that the complaint be revived should respondent fail to comply with the terms of the Compromise Agreement.[23]In an Extended Resolution dated June 22, 2021, the IBP-BOG resolved to grant respondent's MR and Supplemental MR and recommended the dismissal of the complaint. The IBP-BOG held as follows:This admitted failure of respondent to settle his obligations appears to have been cured by events subsequent to the issuance of the June 17, 2019 Resolution of the 23rd Board. More specifically, and as admitted by complainant, respondent had: (a) paid it the sum of [PHP]750,000.00, (b) executed a compromise agreement with complainant which enumerated how he will settle his loan obligation with complainant, and (c) issued postdated checks to complainant. In fact, complainant had even asked this Board not to sanction respondent with suspension so that he can duly pay his loan obligations to complainant.Clearly, these undisputed events reveal respondent's honest attempts to settle his loan obligation with the complainant and duly refute any notion that he used legal maneuverings to renege [on] his obligation with complainant. And with respondent's initial payment, his execution of a compromise agreement and his issuance of postdated checks to complainant, the interests of complainant on the said load had been fully protected. To the mind of this Board, these events thus show [that] respondent did not deliberately violate the spirit and letter of Rule 16.04 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Hence, the dismissal of the instant case is warranted.[24]The Court's RulingThe Court adopts the recommendation of the IBP-BOG to dismiss the complaint against respondent.While it is clear that a lawyer-client relationship exists between respondent and Megamitch, there is no sufficient basis to hold respondent administratively liable for violating the prohibition on borrowing of money or property from clients.The prohibition against borrowing of money or property from clients is originally found in Rule 16.04, Canon 16 of the CPR, and reads as follows:Rule 16.04 â A lawyer shall not borrow money from his client unless the client's interest are fully protected by the nature of the case or by independent advice. Neither shall a lawyer lend money to a client except, when in the interest of justice, he has to advance necessary expenses in a legal matter he is handling for the client. (Underscoring supplied)The purpose of the prohibition is to protect the trust and confidence reposed by the client upon the lawyer. It is designed to prevent lawyers from taking advantage of the client's trust or evading their obligations through legal maneuverings. As held by the Court in Yu v. Dela Cruz,[25] viz.:The Court has repeatedly emphasized that the relationship between a lawyer and his client is one imbued with trust and confidence. And as true as any natural tendency goes, this ""trust and confidence"" is prone to abuse. The rule against borrowing of money by a lawyer from his client is intended to prevent the lawyer from taking advantage of his influence over his client. The rule presumes that the client is disadvantaged by the lawyer's ability to use all the legal maneuverings to renege on his obligation. Suffice it to say, the borrowing of money or property from a client outside the limits laid down in the CPR is an unethical act that warrants sanction.[26]On April 11, 2023, the Court issued a Resolution in A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC, adopting the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA), which supersedes and repeals the CPR.[27] The Transitory Provision of the CPRA specifies that it shall apply retroactively to all pending cases.[28] Accordingly, the Court shall resolve the present case in accordance with the provisions of the CPRA.The CPRA introduces a revised rule on the prohibition on borrowing of money or property from a client. Unlike its predecessor, Canon III, Section 52 of the CPRA outlines three exceptions to this prohibition, viz.:Section 52. Prohibition on Lending and borrowing; exceptions. â . . .Neither shall a lawyer borrow money from a client during the existence of the lawyer-client relationship, unless the client's interests are fully protected by the nature of the case, or by independent advice. This rule does not apply to standard commercial transactions for products or services that the client offers to the public in general, or where the lawyer and the client have an existing or prior business relationship, or where there is a contract between the lawyer and the client.[29] (Underscoring supplied)The exceptions in Section 52 of the CPRA are intended to carve out specific transactions where the prohibition on borrowing of money or property from clients does not apply. These exceptions recognize that legitimate business transactions can occur between lawyers and clients outside the scope of their professional relationships. Still, not all business transactions are exempt from the prohibition. Only transactions where the lawyer avails of the products and services generally offered by the client to the public, where there is an existing or prior business relationship between the lawyer and the client, or where the transaction is covered by a contract, are excluded from the prohibition. In these cases, the client's interests are safeguarded through formal agreements or through the client's knowledge of the business arrangement, ensuring that the transaction does not compromise the lawyer's duties of trust and loyalty to the client.Here, the Court finds that the loan transaction between Megamitch and respondent is excluded from the prohibition against borrowing of money from a client.Firstly, the subject loan is a standard commercial transaction relating to the business of Megamitch. Both parties alleged in their pleadings that Megamitch is engaged in the lending business and that the loan extended to respondent was one of its business transactions. In his Answer[30] dated August 24, 2017, respondent alleged that Megamitch is engaged in lending and financing. Complainant did not refute this allegation and even asserted in his Position Paper[31] dated April 6, 2018, that the loan extended to respondent ""was made in violation [of] Megamitch's Loan Policies on the requirement for borrowers to execute a loan agreement and the posting of sufficient sureties or the conveyance of valid collaterals.""[32]Secondly, Megamitch had an existing business relationship with respondent when they entered the subject loan transaction in January 2015. Complainant does not dispute respondent's allegation that Megamitch extended a loan to respondent in 2014 which respondent fully paid in 2016, viz.:Respondent admits the contractual relation between the Respondent and Megamitch represented by herein Complainant. In fact, this is not the only contractual obligation the Respondent has with Megamitch. In 2014, Respondent contracted a loan obligation with Megamitch in the amount of [PHP]500,000.00, which Respondent had faithfully and punctually paid his monthly amortization until it expired last December 2016.[33]Lastly, while the transaction does not fall squarely under the third exception since no formal agreement was executed because of Megamitch's refusal to sign the Loan Agreement with Chattel Mortgage, the parties' allegations still prove that a contract of loan was perfected between Megamitch and respondent. In fact, complainant's claim for repayment and complaint for Estafa is based on said loan.Apart from the fact that the subject loan transaction is excluded from the prohibition against borrowing of money from clients, the Court also finds a lack of sufficient evidence to substantiate the claims of abuse of trust and misrepresentation employed by respondent. Complainant contends that respondent took advantage of his personal relationship with De Schouwer, as well as his position as Megamitch's retained counsel, to facilitate the release of the loan proceeds without complying with the Loan Policy. Additionally, complainant claims that respondent and Rentillosa misrepresented that he is engaged in the same and gravel business in Iligan City and Lanao del Norte.In support of these allegations, complainant only presented a copy of a Certification[34] issued by the Office of the Treasurer of Iligan City stating that respondent has no business records in the city. This hardly amounts to substantial evidence that would compel the Court to exercise its disciplinary power. For the same reason, the Court also cannot accede to complainant's prayer to revive the complaint should respondent fail to abide by the terms of their Compromise Agreement.ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds that there is no sufficient basis to hold Atty. Rejoice S. Subejano liable for violation of Canon III, Section 52 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. Accordingly, the complaint is DISMISSED for lack of merit.SO ORDERED.Inting and Dimaampao, JJ., concur.Gaerlan,* J., on official business.Singh,** J., on leave.* On official business. ** On leave.[1] Rollo, pp. 1-3, Letter-Complaint for Disbarment dated March 7, 2017.[2] Id. at 27-28, Complaint for Estafa dated April 25, 2016.[3] Id. at 5-6, Retainership Contract dated January 15, 2014.[4] Id. at 27-28, Complaint for Estafa dated April 25, 2016.[5] Id. at 1, Letter-Complaint for Disbarment dated March 7, 2017; 164-165, Judicial Affidavit of Alain De Schouwer.[6] Id. at 159, Judicial Affidavit of Complainant.[7] Id. at 31, Complaint for Estafa dated April 25, 2016.[8] Id.[9] Id. at 2, Letter-Complaint for Disbarment dated March 7, 2017.[10] Id. at 169, Position Paper of Respondent dated May 11, 2018.[11] Id.[12] Id. at 171-176.[13] Id. at 170.[14] Id. at 171.[15] Id.[16] Id. at 176.[17] Id. at 199-201.[18] Id. at 198.[19] Id. at 202-207.[20] Id. at 211-212.[21] Id. at 213-216.[22] Id. at 221-223, Comment of Complainant to Respondent's MR.[23] Id. at 222.[24] Id.[25] 778 Phil. 557 (2016) [Per Curiam, En Banc].[26] Id. at 564.[27] CODE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY, General Provisions, sec. 2.[28] CODE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY, General Provisions, sec. 1.[29] CODE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY, Canon III, sec. 52.[30] Rollo, pp. 55-57.[31] Id. at 152-157.[32] Id. at 153.[33] Id. at 169.[34] Id. at 10.","This resolves the complaint[1] for disbarment filed by complainant Henry G.

Bruel (Bruel) of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019.[4] I In 2009, the United Boatmen Association of Pagsanjan (UBAP) filed a complaint for violation of Section 3(e), (g), (h), (i) and G) of Republic Act No. 3019 and Republic Act No. 9184[5] against Municipality of Pagsanjan, Laguna Mayor Estregan, Vice-Mayor Crisostomo B. Vilar (Vilar), Municipal Councilors Torres, Talabong, Rabago, Sacluti, Dimaranan, and Ronaldo C. Sablan (Sablan; accused public officials),[6] as well as private individual Bruel (collectively, accused-appellants) before the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB), alleging that the accused public officials had unlawfully entered a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for Accident Protection and Assistance (APA) with Bruel, proprietor of First Rapids Care Ventures (FRCV), without public bidding and despite the fact that FRCV holds no Certificate of Authority from the Insurance Commission. After preliminary investigation, the OMB found probable cause to indict all accused for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019. Thus, on March 16, 2016, the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) filed an Information before the SBN, the accusatory portion of which reads: On 23 October 2008, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in the Municipality of Pagsanjan, Province of Laguna, Philippines, and within this Honorable Court's jurisdiction; accused public officers of the municipality of Pagsanjan, Laguna, with the following names and public positions: 1. JEORGE EJERCITO ESTREGAN (SG-27) Municipal Mayor, 2. CRISOSTOMO B. VILAR (SG-25) Municipal Vice Mayor, 3. ARLYN LAZARO-TORRES (SG-24) Municipal Councilor, 4. TERRYL GAMIT-TALABONG (SG-24) Municipal Councilor, 5. KALAHI U. RABAGO (SG-24) Municipal Councilor, 6. ERWIN P. SACLUTI (SG-24) Municipal Councilor, 7. GENER C. DIMARANAN (SG-24) Municipal Councilor, 8. RONALDO C. SABLAN (SG-24) Municipal Councilor; acting in their capacities as Municipal Mayor and as Members of the Sangguniang Bayan ng Pagsanjan, Laguna, committing the crime herein charged in relation to their official functions and taking advantage of their public positions; while in the performance of their administrative and/or official functions; conspiring and confederating with one another and with MARILYN M. BRUEL, Owner and Proprietor of the private entity First Rapids Care Ventures (FRCV); and acting with manifest partiality, evident bad faith and/or gross inexcusable negligence; did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and criminally give unwarranted benefit, advantage and preference to MARILYN M. BRUEL and/or FRCV by entering into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with FRCV to provide accident protection and financial assistance to Pagsanjan tourists and legitimate and qualified boatmen plying the route to and from the Pagsanjan Gorge Tourist Zone for loss of life, disablement, medical reimbursement, and ambulance/hospital transfer reimbursement, without the requisite public bidding under Republic Act No. 9184 and despite FRCV not being licensed and in possession of a certificate of authority from the Insurance Commission to engage in the insurance business; which MOA was immediately ratified and approved by the accused Sangguniang Bayan members despite the previously stated obvious flaws to the damage and prejudice of the municipality, the covered tourists and boatmen. CONTRARY TO LAW.[7] On their respective arraignment dates, accused-appellants pleaded not guilty to the charge. During pre-trial, the parties stipulated that at the time material to the allegations in the Information, accused public officials were public officials of the Municipality of Pagsanjan, Laguna; Bruel was the proprietor of FRCV; the Sangguniang Bayan (SB) of Pagsanjan passed Municipal Ordinance No. 15-2008 authorizing Estregan to transact, negotiate, and enter into a contract between the Municipality and any competent and qualified entity which can provide APA services to tourists and boatmen during boat rides in the Pagsanjan Gorge Tourist Zone; in a September 22, 2008 letter, FRCV submitted its written proposal detailing the APA services it would provide; on October 23, 2008, Estregan, in behalf of the Municipality, entered a MOA with FRCV for APA services which the SB ratified through Municipal Resolution No. 056-2008. They also stipulated on the existence, due execution, and genuineness of Municipal Ordinance No. 15-2008, Municipal Resolution No. 056-2008, FRCV's Letter dated September 22, 2008, and the MOA, among others.[8] Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued. With the above stipulations, the prosecution presented its sole witness, Chantal Mae V. Simon of the Administrative Division-Records Section of the Insurance Commission, who identified the certified copy of the Letter-Opinion of Insurance Commissioner Emmanuel F. Dooc to Atty. Adoracion A. Agbada, Director of OMB-Luzon, where he opined that the MOA between the Municipality of Pagsanjan and FRCV is a contract of insurance.[9] After the prosecution rested its case, Estregan, Rabago, Dimaranan, and Sacluti filed a Motion for Leave of Court to File Demurrer to Evidence which the SBN denied.[10] Hence, they proceeded to present their evidence. The SBN summarizes the evidence for the defense as follows: [Accused Gamit-Talabong and Lazaro-Torres testified that they] were Municipal Councilors when Municipal Ordinances Nos. [14-2008, 15-2008, 56-2008, and 20-2008] were passed. They voted in favor of the said Ordinances, believing that it was for the best interest of the public. Nobody solicited their vote or asked that they endorse said legislative acts. They admit having ratified the MOA entered into by [Estregan] and FRCV after having studied the matter and soliciting opinions from various lawyers. They also discussed whether the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) should be involved. However, when the issue was referred to the BAC, it refused to act on it since there was no approved budget for the contract, and that the procedures under the procurement law could not be applied. . . . . Accused Estregan, Rabago, Dimaranan, and Sacluti cumulatively presented four witnesses, namely: (i) [Dimaranan]; (ii) Ronie S. Leron, President of UBAP from 11 April 2011 to 31 March 2017; (iii) Minerva L. Boongaling, Municipal Treasurer; and (iv) [Estregan]. In addition to their admissions pertaining to the execution of the MOA with FRCV and the passage of the subject ordinances and resolution, their testimonies may be summarized as follows: The Municipal Government of Pagsanjan saw the need for an APA program due to several accidents involving tourists and boatmen ""shooting the rapids"" at the Pagsanjan Gorge. In view thereof, the [SB] held public consultative meetings and/or hearings with the Department of Tourism and tour operators to discuss the possibility of increasing the boat ride service fee in order to accommodate the APA. The [SB] thereafter passed Ordinance No. 14-2008, authorizing [Estregan] to contract with a competent and qualified entity to provide such APA services. Upon such authority, [Estregan] received inquiries from insurance companies such Philamlife, Inc. (Philamlife) and Oriental Insurance (Oriental), but he determined that such companies were unable to provide all of the requirements for the service, namely: (i) accident protection for tourists and boatmen; (ii) deployment of a skilled first aid team; (iii) having a search-and-rescue team; and (iv) maintaining a monitoring team for the entire boat ride. In particular, Philamlife did not agree with the amount of PhP 43.00 for its services, while Oriental did not want to assume the risks entailed by the program. On 22 September 2008, FRCV formally submitted its written proposals containing the services it was willing and competent to provide. [Estregan] found FRCV's proposal to be satisfactory and he was also convinced of its capability to perform the required services. Nonetheless, he insisted that the latter make a presentation before the [SB] so that it can be the judge of the said company's viability. Hence, a certain Mr. Salvador from FRCV conducted a second product presentation before the [SB]. On 13 October 2008, a public consultation was held at the Municipal Building, which was attended by members of the [SB], the UBAP, a representative from Cavinti, and representatives from resorts and hotels to discuss the increase in boatmen's take-home pay, apart from the provision of the APA service. After finding FRCV's proposal satisfactory and sufficient, [Estregan] entered into the MOA with FRCV on 23 October 2008. By motion of herein accused [SB] members, the said MOA was ratified on the same day. The funds for the APA Program were to be sourced from the boat ride service fee and as such was deemed as a special fund... held in trust by the Municipal Government in favor of FRCV since it did not involve the disbursement of public funds from the Municipality's general fund. Under the said MOA, the Municipality's role was limited to the collection of the APA fee through the Municipal Treasurer, who held the funds in trust. This facility was used since her office already served as the collecting agent for the Boatmen's Trust Fund Fee, which likewise formed part of the boat ride service fee. Boat ride tickets were sold at the Municipal Treasurer's Office. Hotels and resorts providing tour packages bought the tickets in advance ... A boat ride ticket was sold for [PHP] 160.00 which amount already covers the APA fee and other fees provided in Ordinance 14-2008, as amended by Ordinance 18-2008, as follows: Provision Amount Pagsanjan Boatride Fee Share PhP 30.00 Cavinti Boatride Fee Share 15.00 Lumban Boatride Fee Share 15.00 Provincial Government Share 6.00 Tourist & Boatman Accident Protection Assistance 48.00 Tourism Promotions 8.00 Barangay Shares 16.00 Trust Fund: Boatmen's Benefit and Welfare 20.00 UBAP Operations Fund 2.00 Total: 160.00 The payments collected from the boat ride tickets were deposited on the next banking day at the Land Bank branch wherein the Municipality's General Fund Account was maintained. The collector assigned to the fund submits an Abstract of Collections and Report on Collection Deposits to account for the sums thus received. The Municipal Accountant... accounts for the said funds and inputs the corresponding entries in the Municipality's books. The amounts due to FRCV as its share in the APA fees were remitted via check, accompanied by the corresponding disbursement voucher. During the entire course of FRCV's contract with the Municipality of Pagsanjan, it was able to provide coverage for accident protection assistance to tourists and boatmen who suffered injury or death in relation to the use and maintenance of tourist services at the Pagsanjan Gorge. Finally, accused point out that the current Board of Directors of the UBAP executed Resolution No. 19-2013 to signify its intent to desist from the affidavit-complaint dated 6 August 2009 filed by its former Board of Directors against herein accused. The affidavit-complaint was filed because the previous Board was not in favor of the APA program... whereas the new Board... decided to desist because of their belief that there was a mere misunderstanding and misapprehension of facts on the part of the previous [Board], and have now realized the need for the said services.[11] In its assailed Decision, the SBN acquitted Vilar for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, but found Estregan, Torres, Talabong, Rabago, Sacluti, Dimaranan, and Bruel guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019. It found that the accused public officials entered a contract for casualty insurance with FRCV despite the latter not being legally capacitated to engage in the business of insurance as it did not possess a Certificate of Authority from the Insurance Commission. According to the SBN, Estregan's acts were attended by evident bad faith when he used his office to obligate the Municipality to enter a contract with FRCV without the requisite determination by a BAC of its qualification, ability, and capacity, in violation of Republic Act No. 9184 and the Local Government Code. He also exhibited manifest partiality in favor of FRCV by declaring its capacity, which is equivalent to pre-qualification, to render services. As for the acts of accused SB members, their own admissions betray the unlawfulness of their actions, and their complicity in the intent to award the contract to FRCV. They ratified the MOA on the same day that it was entered, with full knowledge that the contract was not vetted through public bidding. The SBN disregarded their defense of good faith and belief that no bidding was required since the legal opinions on said matter were sought only after the MOA had already been signed by Estregan and ratified by the SB. The haste by which they ratified the MOA admits of their predilection to favor Bruel's offer and serves as evidence of their concurrence and unity in purpose with Estregan. The decretal portion of the SBN's assailed Decision reads: WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is rendered as follows: Accused JEORGE EJERCITO ESTREGAN, ARLYN LAZARO TORRES, TERRYL GAMIT-TALABONG, KALAHI U. RABAGO, ERWIN P. SACLUTI, GENER C. DIMARANAN, and MARILYN M. BRUEL are hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of Sec. 3(e) of [Republic Act] No. 3019, as amended, and are accordingly sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of [six] years and [one] month as minimum to [eight] years as maximum, with perpetual disqualification from holding public office. Accused CRISOSTOMO B. VILAR is hereby ACQUITTED of the charge of Violation of Sec. 3(e) of [Republic Act] No. 3019, for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt... SO ORDERED.[12] (Emphasis in the original) The SBN denied accused-appellants' respective motions for reconsideration in its assailed Resolution.[13] Aggrieved, all accused-appellants appealed before this Court and filed their briefs except for Estregan who sought additional time to file the same. In their Memorandum Brief,[14] Torres and Talabong claimed that: (1) they acted in good faith and were merely performing their official function as SB members when they signed Resolution No. 056-2008; (2) they had no knowledge that the source of the fund for the project of providing APA services was public in nature; (3) there could be no conspiracy in this case, especially since Talabong was in the opposition during Estregan's administration; and (4) the MOA was riot an insurance contract but one for special services. On the other hand Rabago, Sacluti, and Dimaranan contended in their Memorandum Brief[15] that no irregularity attended the passage of Municipal Resolution No. 056-2008, and that Estregan transacted, negotiated, and contracted APA services with FRCV alone and never listened to anybody as he did what he wanted. They further claimed that there was no conspiracy but only pressure at the time to get the sympathy of the boatmen considering the amount of votes they can provide during the election. Bruel argued in her Brief[16] that: (1) not all the elements of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 were present; (2) the subject municipal ordinances and resolution were not revenue raising measures but were issued in view of the municipality's governmental functions; (3) the MOA did not pertain to a casualty insurance contract but was for special services and thus did not require public bidding; and (4) there was no evidence of conspiracy. The OSP, in their first Brief[17] dated June 18, 2020, retorted that: (1) accused-appellants availed of the wrong mode of appeal; thus, their conviction has already attained finality and is immutable; (2) the SBN correctly found them guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the charge; and (3) conspiracy attended the commission of the offense. Estregan, on the other hand, requested additional time to file his Brief due to change of counsel,[18] which the Court granted in its March 2, 2020 Resolution.[19] However, since Estregan's new counsel, Atty. Bernas, failed to file the Brief within the extended period, the Court required him to show cause why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with or held in contempt, and reiterated its September 25, 2019 Resolution requiring him to file the Brief.[20] On June 25, 2021, Atty. Bernas filed an unsigned Motion for Extension to Comply with the Show Cause Order,[21] pointing to the pandemic and resignation of his associate as reasons for failing to comply, which the Court denied in its September 29, 2021 Resolution for being unsigned.[22] However, this Resolution was not sent to Atty. Bernas's office address in Makati City, but was mistakenly sent to the office address of Estregan's former counsel in BiÃ±an, Laguna, and was, thus, returned to sender.[23] On September 15, 2023, Atty. Bernas filed a Compliance with Motion to Admit (Attached Appellant's Brief),[24] praying for leniency and apologizing for his delay in complying with the Court's orders due to incomplete file turnover, lack of access to relevant parties, and the successive resignations of his associates during the pandemic. Atty. Bernas's excuses fail to persuade. Rule 7, Section 3 of the 2019 Amended Rules of Court commands that written submissions be signed by the party or counsel representing him or her, and that a violation of this Rule may warrant sanction. The fact that he filed Estregan's Brief more than three years after the Court granted his request for additional time in its March 2, 2020 Resolution betrays his negligence, if not abandonment, of the appeal. Finally, the same still utterly fails on the merits as will be later discussed. Estregan's Brief[25] argues that the SBN erred in convicting him despite the prosecution's failure to prove criminal intent, the existence of evident bad faith, manifest partiality, or inexcusable negligence, and the existence of undue injury or unwarranted benefits given to any party. Further, he contends that the SBN disregarded the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties. He insists that the boat ride fee did not form part of the municipality's public funds; that public bidding was not required for the APA program; and that the MOA was not an insurance contract. The OSP, in its second Brief dated December 7, 2023,[26] moved for the denial of Estregan's appeal on the ground that the non-filing of his Brief within the period prayed for constitutes abandonment of appeal. Even granting it was timely filed, it should still be denied as the SBN correctly convicted him. In his Reply Brief,[27] Estregan retorts that: (1) the power to dismiss an appeal is discretionary; (2) there are compelling reasons to allow his Brief; (3) the evidence of the prosecution is grossly insufficient to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt; (4) the assailed Decision merely relied on the perceived weaknesses and the alleged inability of accused-appellants to prove or corroborate certain aspects of their defense; and (5) no evidence of fraudulent or corrupt motive was presented during trial, as there was no such motive. II Contrary to the OSP's procedural argument, since the appeal to this Court was from a criminal case decided by the SBN in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, accused-appellants correctly filed a notice of appeal pursuant to the 2018 Revised Internal Rules of the Sandiganbayan[28] which prevails over the procedure in Presidential Decree No. 1606.[29] Proceeding now to the merits, We first address whether the MOA was indeed a contract of insurance, and if so, whether public bidding was necessary for its procurement. As correctly observed by the SBN, citing the letter-opinion of the Insurance Commissioner, the MOA is a contract of insurance. A contract of insurance is an agreement whereby one undertakes for a consideration to indemnify another against loss, damage, or liability arising from an unknown or contingent event.[30] The provisions of the MOA unmistakably show an agreement whereby FRCV undertakes to indemnify tourists and/or boatmen for accidental death or dismemberment, and the Municipality for actual expenses that it pays for the treatment and/or confinement of tourists and/or boatmen who suffer accidental injury, but not to exceed the amounts stated in the tables of coverage. Seeking refuge in Our ruling in Philippine Health Care Providers, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,[31] Bruel posits that' if the assumption of risk and indemnification of loss are merely incidental to a business and service is the principal purpose, then it is not in the business of insurance. However, as previously discussed, the indemnification of loss is the principal object of the MOA. As testified by Estregan, he thought it was about time to have a specific program for tourists and boatmen since, on many occasions, freak accidents occurred and he had to personally shoulder the funeral services and repatriation of those who died.[32] If We were to believe his claim that he asked for and received offers from Philamlife and Oriental Insurance, which happen to be insurance companies, this would bolster the fact that indemnification was the principal object of the MOA while tourist protection through skills training and assistance for the boatmen was merely incidental. Moreover, in Philippine Health Care Providers, Inc., We cited American jurisprudence distinguishing medical service corporations from health and accident insurers in that the former undertake to provide prepaid medical services through participating physicians, thus relieving subscribers of any further financial burden, while the latter only undertake to indemnify an insured for medical expenses up to, but not beyond, the schedule of rates contained in the policy.[33] In the present case, FRCV is certainly an accident insurer, albeit operating without authority from the Insurance Commission, since as previously mentioned, it undertook in the MOA to indemnify tourists and/or boatmen for accidental death or dismemberment, and the Municipality for actual expenses that it pays for the treatment and/or confinement of tourists and/or boatmen who suffer accidental injury, but not to exceed the amounts stated in the tables of coverage. Bruel contends that there is nothing in the MOA obliging the Municipality to pay an insurance premium which is an indispensable element of insurance agreements. However, the fact that no profit is derived from the making of insurance contracts, agreements, or transactions or that no separate or direct consideration is received therefore is not conclusive to show that the making thereof does not constitute the doing or transacting of an insurance business.[34] At any rate, contrary to her claim, We agree with the Insurance Commissioner that the consideration or premium under the MOA is termed as ""coverage outlay"" in the amount of PHP 48.00 per tourist. In insisting that FRCV is not in the insurance business despite the MOA, on its face, showing the contrary, it appears that FRCV is doing or proposing to do business in substance equivalent to making, as insurer, an insurance contract in a manner designed to evade the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 612 or the old Insurance Code. Nonetheless, the Code itself states that the term ""doing an insurance business"" within the meaning of said Code shall include ""doing or proposing to do any business in substance equivalent to any of the foregoing in a manner designed to evade the provisions of this Code.""[35] Bruel, of all people, should know this considering that she was an insurance agent for Malayan Insurance Company before she formed FRCV. As an insurance contract, it falls within the definition of goods[36] under Republic Act No. 9184. As the SBN correctly observed, even assuming arguendo that FRCV's services were primarily for providing training to boatmen, such services would fall within the ambit of consulting services which are still within the purview of Republic Act No. 9184. Under Rule IV, Section 10 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 9184, all procurement shall be done through competitive bidding, except as provided in Rule XVI on alternative methods of procurement. Competitive public bidding aims to protect the public interest by giving the public the best possible advantages through open competition, and to avoid or preclude suspicion of favoritism and anomalies in the execution of public contracts. Alternative methods of procurement which dispense with the requirement of open, public, and competitive bidding may be allowed but only in highly exceptional cases.[37] In this case, however, instead of going through the default mode of procurement, the SB passed Municipal Ordinance No. 15-2008 authorizing Estregan to transact, negotiate, and enter a contract between the Municipality and any competent and qualified entity which can provide APA services to tourists and boatmen. In other words, the accused public officials immediately authorized resort to the alternative method of procurement known as negotiated procurement whereby the procuring entity directly negotiates a contract with a technically, legally, and financially capable supplier, contractor, or consultant.[38] However, under the IRR of Republic Act No. 9184, such may only be resorted to in particular cases such as when there are two failed biddings, emergency cases, etc.[39] None of the said cases are availing here. There is thus no doubt that the accused violated procurement law, rules and regulations. While Estregan attempts to justify the lack of public bidding by alleging that both the BAC and the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) confirmed that the same was not required, there is no proof on record that the BAC or the GPPB opined so other than his bare allegation. In criminal cases for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 in relation to procurement irregularities, however, violations of procurement laws, rules, and regulations do not per se lead to the conviction of the public officer under said special penal law. It must be established beyond reasonable doubt that the essential elements of a Section 3(e) violation are present.[40] Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 provides: Sec. 3. Corrupt practices of public officers. In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful: . . . . (e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence... To be found guilty of a Section 3(e) violation, the prosecution must prove that: (1) the accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial, or official functions; (2) accused must have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence; and (3) accused caused any undue injury to any party, including the government, or gave any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference in the discharge of his or her functions.[41] The presence of the first element being undisputed, only the presence of the second and third elements shall be jointly discussed. The second element provides the different modes by which the crime may be committed, that is, through ""manifest partiality,"" ""evident bad faith,"" or ""gross inexcusable negligence."" Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 may be committed either by dolo, as when the accused acted with evident bad faith or manifest partiality, or by culpa, as when the accused committed gross inexcusable negligence. There is ""manifest partiality"" when there is a clear, notorious, or plain inclination or predilection to favor one side or person rather than another. ""Evident bad faith"" connotes not only bad judgment but also palpably and patently fraudulent and dishonest purpose to do moral obliquity or conscious wrongdoing for some perverse motive or ill will. ""Evident bad faith"" contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or with some motive or self-interest or ill will or for ulterior purposes. ""Gross inexcusable negligence"" refers to negligence characterized by the want of even the slightest care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and intentionally, with conscious indifference to consequences insofar as other persons may be affected.[42] Under the third element, the act or omission must have caused undue injury to any party, including the Government, and/or must have given any private party unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference. Undue injury has been consistently interpreted as actual damage, akin to that in civil law. Under the second mode, which is by giving any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference, ""unwarranted"" means lacking adequate or official support; unjustified; unauthorized; or without justification or adequate reasons. ""Advantage"" means a more favorable or improved position or condition; benefit or gain of any kind. ""Preference"" signifies priority, higher evaluation, or desirability; choice or estimation above another.[43] In this case, Estregan's manifest partiality and evident bad faith was indubitably shown when he entered a MOA with FRCV despite glaringly questionable circumstances such as FRCV being registered with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) only on March 19, 2008 and with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) only on September 17, 2008âjust five days prior to its letter-offerâand its lack of a Certificate of Authority from the Insurance Commission. Thus, Estregan's claim that FRCV was the only qualified company to render the service required by the Municipality deserves scant consideration. The supposed public consultative meetings conducted by the accused public officials with community stakeholders do not negate Estregan's manifest partiality as said meetings only pertained to the proposed increase in the boat ride service fee and had nothing to do with determining the qualifications of FRCV, as this was supposed to be the job of the BAC which Estregan arrogated upon himself. That he even made FRCV present before the SB despite the absence of public bidding and despite irregularities surrounding it further betray his manifest partiality and evident bad faith. As regards the third element, While there is indeed is no estimable proof of damage to any party in this case, said element is satisfied as to the second mode. By purposely sparing FRCV from the rigors of the processes under the procurement law and consciously turning a blind eye to irregularities, Estregan gave it unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference. As earlier discussed, it was utterly unwarranted for FRCV to receive benefit, advantage, or preference because it did not have legal authority to engage in the insurance business in the first place, and did not undergo the proper procurement process. With regard to Bruel, We once again agree with the SBN's findings that she fraudulently claimed that FRCV was fully capacitated to engage in the services enumerated in the MOA when, in truth and in fact, FRCV did not possess a Certificate of Authority from the Insurance Commission to engage in the business of insurance. The fact that she did not represent FRCV to be an insurance company is of no moment since a plain reading of the MOA itself would show that FRCV is doing or transacting an insurance business. Her claim that FRCV is engaged in the specialized field of APA is also belied by its track record. As observed by the SBN, by Bruel's own evidence, FRCV was only registered with the DTI on March 19, 2008 and with the BIR on September 17, 2008, or five days prior to its letter-offer to Estregan, thus, showing that FRCV was merely created for the purpose of rendering the ""specialized services"" for the Municipality sans prior experience. In fact, FRCV's Certificate of Registration with the BIR indicates that its line of business o",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" industry is """"Other Computer Related Activities"""" which has nothing to do with APA services. Hence", she cannot claim good faith and escape liability for her actions. Even assuming that FRCV was able to comply with its duties under the MOA, the same will not serve to negate the fraud that Bruel had perpetrated.[44] Plainly, she conspired with Estregan for her company to be given preferential treatment and unwarranted benefit. Insofar as accused SB members Torres, Talabong, Rabago, Sacluti, and Dimaranan are concerned, however, We find that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt their guilt for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019. To recall, they passed Municipal Ordinance No. 15-2008 authorizing Estregan to transact, negotiate, and enter a contract between the Municipality and any competent and qualified entity which can provide APA services. Even assuming that the ordinance violated procurement law because it immediately authorized resort to negotiated procurement," the SB members did not thereby show manifest partiality and give unwarranted benefit to any particular entity because the ordinance itself states """"any competent and qualified entity"""" and such entity was yet to be determined. It did not even prevent Estregan from resorting to public bidding as it merely authorized negotiated procurement", albeit erroneously. Neither did their eventual ratification of the MOA through Municipal Resolution No. 056-2008 make them liable because the validity of the MOA did not depend on the issuance of said resolution. No rights can be conferred by and be inferred from a resolution, which is but an embodiment of what the lawmaking body has to say in light of attendant circumstances.[45] As such, their acquittal is warranted. ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is PARTLY GRANTED. The April 5, 2019 Decision and July 5, 2019 Resolution of the Sandiganbayan in SB-16-CRM-0124 are AFFIRMED insofar as accused-appellants Jeorge Ejercito Estregan and Marilyn M. Bruel were found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3(e), Republic Act No. 3019 and were sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of six years and one month as minimum to eight years as maximum with perpetual disqualification from holding public office.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue,[31] Bruel posits that' if the assumption of risk and indemnification of loss are merely incidental to a business and service is the principal purpose, then it is not in the business of insurance. However, as previously discussed, the indemnification of loss is the principal object of the MOA. As testified by Estregan, he thought it was about time to have a specific program for tourists and boatmen since, on many occasions, freak accidents occurred and he had to personally shoulder the funeral services and repatriation of those who died.[32] If We were to believe his claim that he asked for and received offers from Philamlife and Oriental Insurance, which happen to be insurance companies, this would bolster the fact that indemnification was the principal object of the MOA while tourist protection through skills training and assistance for the boatmen was merely incidental. Moreover, in Philippine Health Care Providers, Inc., We cited American jurisprudence distinguishing medical service corporations from health and accident insurers in that the former undertake to provide prepaid medical services through participating physicians, thus relieving subscribers of any further financial burden, while the latter only undertake to indemnify an insured for medical expenses up to, but not beyond, the schedule of rates contained in the policy.[33] In the present case, FRCV is certainly an accident insurer, albeit operating without authority from the Insurance Commission, since as previously mentioned, it undertook in the MOA to indemnify tourists and/or boatmen for accidental death or dismemberment, and the Municipality for actual expenses that it pays for the treatment and/or confinement of tourists and/or boatmen who suffer accidental injury, but not to exceed the amounts stated in the tables of coverage. Bruel contends that there is nothing in the MOA obliging the Municipality to pay an insurance premium which is an indispensable element of insurance agreements. However, the fact that no profit is derived from the making of insurance contracts, agreements, or transactions or that no separate or direct consideration is received therefore is not conclusive to show that the making thereof does not constitute the doing or transacting of an insurance business.[34] At any rate, contrary to her claim, We agree with the Insurance Commissioner that the consideration or premium under the MOA is termed as ""coverage outlay"" in the amount of PHP 48.00 per tourist. In insisting that FRCV is not in the insurance business despite the MOA, on its face, showing the contrary, it appears that FRCV is doing or proposing to do business in substance equivalent to making, as insurer, an insurance contract in a manner designed to evade the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 612 or the old Insurance Code. Nonetheless, the Code itself states that the term ""doing an insurance business"" within the meaning of said Code shall include ""doing or proposing to do any business in substance equivalent to any of the foregoing in a manner designed to evade the provisions of this Code.""[35] Bruel, of all people, should know this considering that she was an insurance agent for Malayan Insurance Company before she formed FRCV. As an insurance contract, it falls within the definition of goods[36] under Republic Act No. 9184. As the SBN correctly observed, even assuming arguendo that FRCV's services were primarily for providing training to boatmen, such services would fall within the ambit of consulting services which are still within the purview of Republic Act No. 9184. Under Rule IV, Section 10 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 9184, all procurement shall be done through competitive bidding, except as provided in Rule XVI on alternative methods of procurement. Competitive public bidding aims to protect the public interest by giving the public the best possible advantages through open competition, and to avoid or preclude suspicion of favoritism and anomalies in the execution of public contracts. Alternative methods of procurement which dispense with the requirement of open, public, and competitive bidding may be allowed but only in highly exceptional cases.[37] In this case, however, instead of going through the default mode of procurement, the SB passed Municipal Ordinance No. 15-2008 authorizing Estregan to transact, negotiate, and enter a contract between the Municipality and any competent and qualified entity which can provide APA services to tourists and boatmen. In other words, the accused public officials immediately authorized resort to the alternative method of procurement known as negotiated procurement whereby the procuring entity directly negotiates a contract with a technically, legally, and financially capable supplier, contractor, or consultant.[38] However, under the IRR of Republic Act No. 9184, such may only be resorted to in particular cases such as when there are two failed biddings, emergency cases, etc.[39] None of the said cases are availing here. There is thus no doubt that the accused violated procurement law, rules and regulations. While Estregan attempts to justify the lack of public bidding by alleging that both the BAC and the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) confirmed that the same was not required, there is no proof on record that the BAC or the GPPB opined so other than his bare allegation. In criminal cases for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 in relation to procurement irregularities, however, violations of procurement laws, rules, and regulations do not per se lead to the conviction of the public officer under said special penal law. It must be established beyond reasonable doubt that the essential elements of a Section 3(e) violation are present.[40] Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 provides: Sec. 3. Corrupt practices of public officers. In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful: . . . . (e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence... To be found guilty of a Section 3(e) violation, the prosecution must prove that: (1) the accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial, or official functions; (2) accused must have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence; and (3) accused caused any undue injury to any party, including the government, or gave any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference in the discharge of his or her functions.[41] The presence of the first element being undisputed, only the presence of the second and third elements shall be jointly discussed. The second element provides the different modes by which the crime may be committed, that is, through ""manifest partiality,"" ""evident bad faith,"" or ""gross inexcusable negligence."" Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 may be committed either by dolo, as when the accused acted with evident bad faith or manifest partiality, or by culpa, as when the accused committed gross inexcusable negligence. There is ""manifest partiality"" when there is a clear, notorious, or plain inclination or predilection to favor one side or person rather than another. ""Evident bad faith"" connotes not only bad judgment but also palpably and patently fraudulent and dishonest purpose to do moral obliquity or conscious wrongdoing for some perverse motive or ill will. ""Evident bad faith"" contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or with some motive or self-interest or ill will or for ulterior purposes. ""Gross inexcusable negligence"" refers to negligence characterized by the want of even the slightest care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and intentionally, with conscious indifference to consequences insofar as other persons may be affected.[42] Under the third element, the act or omission must have caused undue injury to any party, including the Government, and/or must have given any private party unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference. Undue injury has been consistently interpreted as actual damage, akin to that in civil law. Under the second mode, which is by giving any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference, ""unwarranted"" means lacking adequate or official support; unjustified; unauthorized; or without justification or adequate reasons. ""Advantage"" means a more favorable or improved position or condition; benefit or gain of any kind. ""Preference"" signifies priority, higher evaluation, or desirability; choice or estimation above another.[43] In this case, Estregan's manifest partiality and evident bad faith was indubitably shown when he entered a MOA with FRCV despite glaringly questionable circumstances such as FRCV being registered with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) only on March 19, 2008 and with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) only on September 17, 2008âjust five days prior to its letter-offerâand its lack of a Certificate of Authority from the Insurance Commission. Thus, Estregan's claim that FRCV was the only qualified company to render the service required by the Municipality deserves scant consideration. The supposed public consultative meetings conducted by the accused public officials with community stakeholders do not negate Estregan's manifest partiality as said meetings only pertained to the proposed increase in the boat ride service fee and had nothing to do with determining the qualifications of FRCV, as this was supposed to be the job of the BAC which Estregan arrogated upon himself. That he even made FRCV present before the SB despite the absence of public bidding and despite irregularities surrounding it further betray his manifest partiality and evident bad faith. As regards the third element, While there is indeed is no estimable proof of damage to any party in this case, said element is satisfied as to the second mode. By purposely sparing FRCV from the rigors of the processes under the procurement law and consciously turning a blind eye to irregularities, Estregan gave it unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference. As earlier discussed, it was utterly unwarranted for FRCV to receive benefit, advantage, or preference because it did not have legal authority to engage in the insurance business in the first place, and did not undergo the proper procurement process. With regard to Bruel, We once again agree with the SBN's findings that she fraudulently claimed that FRCV was fully capacitated to engage in the services enumerated in the MOA when, in truth and in fact, FRCV did not possess a Certificate of Authority from the Insurance Commission to engage in the business of insurance. The fact that she did not represent FRCV to be an insurance company is of no moment since a plain reading of the MOA itself would show that FRCV is doing or transacting an insurance business. Her claim that FRCV is engaged in the specialized field of APA is also belied by its track record. As observed by the SBN, by Bruel's own evidence, FRCV was only registered with the DTI on March 19, 2008 and with the BIR on September 17, 2008, or five days prior to its letter-offer to Estregan, thus, showing that FRCV was merely created for the purpose of rendering the ""specialized services"" for the Municipality sans prior experience. In fact, FRCV's Certificate of Registration with the BIR indicates that its line of business or industry is ""Other Computer Related Activities"" which has nothing to do with APA services. Hence, she cannot claim good faith and escape liability for her actions. Even assuming that FRCV was able to comply with its duties under the MOA, the same will not serve to negate the fraud that Bruel had perpetrated.[44] Plainly, she conspired with Estregan for her company to be given preferential treatment and unwarranted benefit. Insofar as accused SB members Torres, Talabong, Rabago, Sacluti, and Dimaranan are concerned, however, We find that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt their guilt for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019. To recall, they passed Municipal Ordinance No. 15-2008 authorizing Estregan to transact, negotiate, and enter a contract between the Municipality and any competent and qualified entity which can provide APA services. Even assuming that the ordinance violated procurement law because it immediately authorized resort to negotiated procurement, the SB members did not thereby show manifest partiality and give unwarranted benefit to any particular entity because the ordinance itself states ""any competent and qualified entity"" and such entity was yet to be determined. It did not even prevent Estregan from resorting to public bidding as it merely authorized negotiated procurement, albeit erroneously. Neither did their eventual ratification of the MOA through Municipal Resolution No. 056-2008 make them liable because the validity of the MOA did not depend on the issuance of said resolution. No rights can be conferred by and be inferred from a resolution, which is but an embodiment of what the lawmaking body has to say in light of attendant circumstances.[45] As such, their acquittal is warranted. ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is PARTLY GRANTED. The April 5, 2019 Decision and July 5, 2019 Resolution of the Sandiganbayan in SB-16-CRM-0124 are AFFIRMED insofar as accused-appellants Jeorge Ejercito Estregan and Marilyn M. Bruel were found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3(e), Republic Act No. 3019 and were sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of six years and one month as minimum to eight years as maximum with perpetual disqualification from holding public office. However, the same Decision and Resolution are MODIFIED in that accused-appellants Arlyn Lazaro-Torres, Terryl Gamit-Talabong, Kalahi U. Rabago, Erwin P. Sacluti, and Gener C. Dimaranan are ACQUITTED of the same crime on the ground of reasonable doubt. Let entry of judgment be issued as to said acquitted accused-appellants. SO ORDERED. Gesmundo, C.J.

SPOUSES OSCAR AND NORMA NUNEZ, THE CITY ASSESSOR OF QUEZON CITY, AND THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF QUEZON CITY, RESPONDENTS. February 05, 2025","Antecedents This case stems from conflicting claims of ownership over a 243.50-square meter parcel of land with improvements located at No. 20, Corregidor Street, Bago Bantay, Quezon City (Corregidor Property).[5] Spouses Conrado NuÃ±ez, Sr. (Conrado, Sr.) and Maria NuÃ±ez (Maria) had six children, namely: Conrado NuÃ±ez, Jr. (Conrado, Jr.), Clarita NuÃ±ezÂ­ Abraham (Clarita), Celia NuÃ±ez-NuÃ±ez (Celia), Eduveges NuÃ±ez-Alinea (Eduveges), Helen NuÃ±ez-Quiozon (Helen), and Oscar NuÃ±ez (Oscar). Norma NuÃ±ez (Norma) is the wife of Oscar.[6] Conrado, Sr., Maria, Eduveges, and Helen are already deceased.[7] The heirs of Eduveges and Helen are represented in this case by Conrado, Jr.[8] Version of Petitioners According to the petitioners, the Corregidor Property is owned by Maria, as evidenced by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 262412[9] dated October 4, 1979, and by Tax Declaration (TD) No. B-090-00788.[10] Only a photocopy of the first page of TCT No. 262412 was presented by petitioners since they cannot locate the owner's duplicate certificate of title despite diligent efforts.[11] In addition, they presented a Certification[12] dated December 6, 2013 from the Registry of Deeds (RD) of Quezon City stating that ""the original of TCT No. 262412 allegedly registered under the name of Maria T[.] Nu[Ã±]ez was not included among those saved titles during the fire that razed the Quezon City Hall Building last June 11, 1988[.]""[13] Maria and her family started occupying the Corregidor Property since the early 1960's. Back then, the improvement on the property was just a house made out of wood. In the 1970's, Maria built a bungalow house with three bedrooms and one toilet and bath for her family. Thereafter, an extension was constructed on the side to add another bedroom for Clarita who just got married that time.[14] In 1981, Maria, together with her daughters, Helen and Eduveges, and the latter's respective husbands, funded the construction of a duplex on the back portion of the property. Around 1987, Conrado, Jr. supervised the construction of a triplex on the front portion of the property since he had no house of his own.[15] Maria funded the construction of the triplex using her retirement benefits, with Helen and Celia adding their respective contributions. However, the construction was discontinued due to insufficient funds. During this period, Oscar, the eldest child, was gainfully employed at the Asian Development Bank.[16] Considering Oscar's background, he was tasked to process a loan application to finish the development of the property. He was also tasked to organize the collection of the respective shares of his siblings for the completion of the construction.[17] In May 1988, Oscar was able to successfully secure a PHP 400,000.00 loan from Union Bank of the Philippines. The Corregidor Property was used as a collateral for the loan.[18] On January 31, 1989, Maria passed away.[19] After full payment of the loan in February 2004, the petitioners discovered that Maria's title and tax declaration were already cancelled, and that TCT No. RT-125152[20] and TD Nos. E-099-00396 and D-090-01967[21] were already issued in the name of Oscar. The petitioners contended that the Corregidor Property is co-owned because the legal title over the same was transferred by Maria to Oscar only for the loan application. She had no real intention of relinquishing her ownership. Unfortunately, Maria was no longer able to transfer the legal title back to her name since she passed away in 1989.[22] To support their claim of co-ownership, petitioners presented their 16 Years Summary Payment Schedule,[23] 9 Y[ea]rs Payment Schedule,[24] and Siblings Contribution 25 Y[ea]rs of Sharing.[25] These show that they shared in the payment of loan amortizations, fire insurance premiums, and real property taxes. It -was Oscar who exacted and pooled the contributions and made the payment to the concerned entities and agencies.[26] In addition, Conrado, Jr. presented his Marriage Contract,[27] his daughter's Certificate of Live Birth,[28] Medicare Form,[29] Voter's Registration,[30] Income Tax Returns,[31] and Statements of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth.[32] Meanwhile, Clarita presented her husband's Income Tax Returns,[33] Application with the Business Permit and Licensing Office,[34] Business Tax Returns,[35] Individual Schedular Income Tax Return,[36] Income Statement,[37] and Individual Gross Income Tax Return.[38] In these documents, the address indicated is No. 20, Corregidor Street, Bago Bantay, Quezon City. Version of Respondents In contrast with the petitioners' narrative, respondents claimed that the Corregidor Property is owned by Oscar as evidenced by TCT No. RT-125152[39] dated October 8, 1987, and TD Nos. E-090-00396 and D-090-01967.[40] The NuÃ±ez family used to live at No. 76, Antique Street, Bago Bantay, Quezon City. After Conrado, Sr.'s death, Oscar, as the eldest son, became the head of the family. Around that time, they transferred to the Corregidor Property which was then government-owned and administered by the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC), now known as the National Housing Authority (NHA).[41] The Corregidor Property was previously awarded to one Jose Jovillo, Jr. However, it became available to new applicants due to his failure to comply with the PHHC's requirements. Being gainfully employed, Oscar applied for the purchase of the property and filed a case for the revocation of the previous award.[42] Pursuant to this, a Compromise Agreement[43] dated November 10, 1975 was executed between Oscar and the NHA. It states in part:","For the Court's resolution is a Petition[1] seeking to set aside the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 115605. The assailed CA rulings reversed the Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court, Quezon City (RTC), Branch 222 in Civil Case No. R-QZN-14-00363-CV. Antecedents This case stems from conflicting claims of ownership over a 243.50-square meter parcel of land with improvements located at No. 20, Corregidor Street, Bago Bantay, Quezon City (Corregidor Property).[5] Spouses Conrado NuÃ±ez, Sr. (Conrado, Sr.) and Maria NuÃ±ez (Maria) had six children, namely: Conrado NuÃ±ez, Jr. (Conrado, Jr.), Clarita NuÃ±ezÂ­ Abraham (Clarita), Celia NuÃ±ez-NuÃ±ez (Celia), Eduveges NuÃ±ez-Alinea (Eduveges), Helen NuÃ±ez-Quiozon (Helen), and Oscar NuÃ±ez (Oscar). Norma NuÃ±ez (Norma) is the wife of Oscar.[6] Conrado, Sr., Maria, Eduveges, and Helen are already deceased.[7] The heirs of Eduveges and Helen are represented in this case by Conrado, Jr.[8] Version of Petitioners According to the petitioners, the Corregidor Property is owned by Maria, as evidenced by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 262412[9] dated October 4, 1979, and by Tax Declaration (TD) No. B-090-00788.[10] Only a photocopy of the first page of TCT No. 262412 was presented by petitioners since they cannot locate the owner's duplicate certificate of title despite diligent efforts.[11] In addition, they presented a Certification[12] dated December 6, 2013 from the Registry of Deeds (RD) of Quezon City stating that ""the original of TCT No. 262412 allegedly registered under the name of Maria T[.] Nu[Ã±]ez was not included among those saved titles during the fire that razed the Quezon City Hall Building last June 11, 1988[.]""[13] Maria and her family started occupying the Corregidor Property since the early 1960's. Back then, the improvement on the property was just a house made out of wood. In the 1970's, Maria built a bungalow house with three bedrooms and one toilet and bath for her family. Thereafter, an extension was constructed on the side to add another bedroom for Clarita who just got married that time.[14] In 1981, Maria, together with her daughters, Helen and Eduveges, and the latter's respective husbands, funded the construction of a duplex on the back portion of the property. Around 1987, Conrado, Jr. supervised the construction of a triplex on the front portion of the property since he had no house of his own.[15] Maria funded the construction of the triplex using her retirement benefits, with Helen and Celia adding their respective contributions. However, the construction was discontinued due to insufficient funds. During this period, Oscar, the eldest child, was gainfully employed at the Asian Development Bank.[16] Considering Oscar's background, he was tasked to process a loan application to finish the development of the property. He was also tasked to organize the collection of the respective shares of his siblings for the completion of the construction.[17] In May 1988, Oscar was able to successfully secure a PHP 400,000.00 loan from Union Bank of the Philippines. The Corregidor Property was used as a collateral for the loan.[18] On January 31, 1989, Maria passed away.[19] After full payment of the loan in February 2004, the petitioners discovered that Maria's title and tax declaration were already cancelled, and that TCT No. RT-125152[20] and TD Nos. E-099-00396 and D-090-01967[21] were already issued in the name of Oscar. The petitioners contended that the Corregidor Property is co-owned because the legal title over the same was transferred by Maria to Oscar only for the loan application. She had no real intention of relinquishing her ownership. Unfortunately, Maria was no longer able to transfer the legal title back to her name since she passed away in 1989.[22] To support their claim of co-ownership, petitioners presented their 16 Years Summary Payment Schedule,[23] 9 Y[ea]rs Payment Schedule,[24] and Siblings Contribution 25 Y[ea]rs of Sharing.[25] These show that they shared in the payment of loan amortizations, fire insurance premiums, and real property taxes. It -was Oscar who exacted and pooled the contributions and made the payment to the concerned entities and agencies.[26] In addition, Conrado, Jr. presented his Marriage Contract,[27] his daughter's Certificate of Live Birth,[28] Medicare Form,[29] Voter's Registration,[30] Income Tax Returns,[31] and Statements of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth.[32] Meanwhile, Clarita presented her husband's Income Tax Returns,[33] Application with the Business Permit and Licensing Office,[34] Business Tax Returns,[35] Individual Schedular Income Tax Return,[36] Income Statement,[37] and Individual Gross Income Tax Return.[38] In these documents, the address indicated is No. 20, Corregidor Street, Bago Bantay, Quezon City. Version of Respondents In contrast with the petitioners' narrative, respondents claimed that the Corregidor Property is owned by Oscar as evidenced by TCT No. RT-125152[39] dated October 8, 1987, and TD Nos. E-090-00396 and D-090-01967.[40] The NuÃ±ez family used to live at No. 76, Antique Street, Bago Bantay, Quezon City. After Conrado, Sr.'s death, Oscar, as the eldest son, became the head of the family. Around that time, they transferred to the Corregidor Property which was then government-owned and administered by the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC), now known as the National Housing Authority (NHA).[41] The Corregidor Property was previously awarded to one Jose Jovillo, Jr. However, it became available to new applicants due to his failure to comply with the PHHC's requirements. Being gainfully employed, Oscar applied for the purchase of the property and filed a case for the revocation of the previous award.[42] Pursuant to this, a Compromise Agreement[43] dated November 10, 1975 was executed between Oscar and the NHA. It states in part: NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the foregoing premises, and in pursuance of the well-considered suggestion of this Honorable Court, the parties have agreed, as they hereby agree, that: 1. The defendant (now, the NHA) shall declare the award made in favor of Jose Jovillo, Jr., under Resolution (PHHC) No. 749, dated May 19, 1964, cancelled, rescinded and forfeited, and simultaneously award the lot in question to the plaintiff under the usual condition that the award unto the plaintiff shall be subject to the existing rules and regulations of the NHA; 2. The price of the said lot shall be the same as that fixed therefor under Resolution (PHHC) No. 1000 dated February 7, 1969, or [PHP] 30.00 per square meter, to be paid by the awardee, the plaintiff herein, in installment and in like manner as other awardees in the same area are allowed to pay; 3. Notwithstanding the cancellation or rescission of the award in favor of Jose Jovillo, Jr., the award to be made in favor of the plaintiff as mentioned hereinabove shall be subject to whatever rights the said Jose Jovillo, Jr. may have acquired over the said lot under the aforesaid Resolution No. 749 as may be finally judicially determined, and the defendant shall in no case be held liable by the plaintiff or his successors-in-interest for damages should the award made in his favor be nullified or otherwise, declared invalid in any appropriate proceeding that may hereafter be initiated or instituted by the said Jose Jovillo, Jr.; 4. The defendant (NHA), through its Board of Directors, shall enact or adopt the appropriate resolution declaring the award in favor of Jose Jovillo, Jr. cancelled or rescinded by reason of abandonment and failure to comply with the conditions thereof, and simultaneously awarding the lot in question to the plaintiff, within thirty (30) days from receipt of notice of the decision of this Honorable Court based on this compromise agreement; and 5. The plaintiff hereby withdraws and waives all his claims for damages, reimbursement of litigation expenses, attorney's fees and costs heretofore made against the defendant and the latter likewise waives any and all claims that it might have made against the plaintiff in connection with this case.[44] To prove payment, respondents presented PHHC Passbook No. 15118[45] under the name of Oscar. In addition, they presented the Deed of Sale[46] dated June 14, 1977 between PHHC and Oscar, and a transmittal letter[47] from the NRA in favor of Oscar stating: This is to certify that on this date 11 November 1977, I have received Transfer Certificate of Title No. 239466 issued by the Register of Deeds of Quezon City... on October 28, 1977 and one (1) copy of the Deed of Sale covering Lot No. 2, Block N.B 5 conveyed to me by the National Housing Authority.[48] In 1981, a case was filed against Maria, among others, for alleged anomalous titling and awarding of the Corregidor Property. The complaint alleged that Maria was able to obtain a title over a parcel of land due to her connections with some local officials of Quezon City and the NHA.[49] In a Resolution[50] dated December 20, 1989, the Office of the Special Prosecutor dismissed the case for insufficiency of evidence. Pertinently, it discussed: On the other hand, respondents submitted the following evidence and arguments, to wit: a) Maria T. NuÃ±ez â she submitted an affidavit stating the lot occupied by her was covered by TCT No. 239466 in the name of her son Oscar T. NuÃ±ez, who gave her special power of attorney to prosecute the squatters; the son, an awardee, purchased it from NHA, after complying with all the requirements in 1976; that her son was then working at ADB, while his wife at the Central Bank; she denied that she was influential in Quezon City since she was only a bindery helper in Quezon City Hall; in support of her claim, she submitted the following proofs: 1. Transfer Certificate of Title No. 239466 in the name of her son; Special Power of Attorney from her son; NHA Clearance dated June 30, 1980 signed by Maj. Gen. Gaudencio V. Tobias, authorizing the demolition team, City Engineer's Office, Quezon City, to dismantle and remove all illegal structures in Lot 2, Block NB-5, situated at No. 20, Corrigidor [sic] St., Bago-Bantay, Quezon City. The clearance further stated, that, the area in question was not within the Areas for Priority Development under [Presidential Decree No.] 1893[.][51] (Emphasis in the original) To help his siblings, Oscar obtained a loan from Union Bank to fund the construction of a new house on the property. Since respondents' full payment of the Corregidor Property in 1977, the petitioners resided therein rent-free. In lieu of rent, Oscar merely requested his siblings to share in the payment of loan amortizations and taxes.[52] In 2013, respondents decided to sell the Corregidor Property. They offered the same to petitioners as the present occupants thereof. However, in December of the same year, respondents received a letter from Atty. Mark Oliver M. Karaan, on behalf of petitioners, seeking the partition of the Corregidor Property since it was their inheritance from their mother, Maria.[53] Eventually, this was followed by the subject Complaint[54] for Annulment of Title and Other Documents, Reconveyance, Damages and Attorney's Fees with Prayer for a Temporary Restraining Order and Writ of Preliminary Injunction filed by the petitioners against respondents. Unlawful Detainer Case It bears noting that respondents, on the other hand, initiated a case for unlawful detainer against the petitioners. This also reached the Court and was docketed as G.R. No. 240652.[55] In said case, the Court ruled in favor of the petitioners herein. It affirmed the common ruling of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), the RTC, and the CA that Sps. Oscar and Norma's complaint failed to allege how and when the entry or dispossession was effected. Thus, they failed to satisfy a jurisdictional requirement for unlawful detainer.[56] This ruling became final on September 4, 2019.[57] Ruling of the Regional Trial Court In its Decision[58] dated July 29, 2019, the RTC ruled m favor of the petitioners. The fallo thereof reads: WHEREFORE, considering the premises, the instant petition is hereby GRANTED. Accordingly, the Transfer Certificate of Title No. RT-125152 under the name of Oscar NuÃ±ez married to Norma Nu[Ã±]ez issued by the Registry of Deeds Quezon City on October 8, 1987 is hereby declared null and void and therefore be [sic] cancelled. Further, the property as well as the improvement therein located at No. 20 Corregidor Street, Bago Bantay, Quezon City is considered as co-owned by the heirs of Maria NuÃ±ez[,] i.e., the plaintiffs as well as the defendants. Meanwhile, the Register of Deeds is hereby directed to reinstate the title of Maria Nu[Ã±]ez under TCT No. 262412. Likewise, the Quezon City Assessor's Office is also directed to reinstate the Tax Declaration of the said title in the name of Maria Nu[Ã±]ez. SO ORDERED.[59] (Emphasis in the original) The RTC gave credence to Maria's title, TCT No. 262412. While it noted that the petitioners were able to present only a photocopy thereof, it found that Oscar's present title, TCT No. RT-125152, was derived from TCT No. 262412. To the RTC, this indication corroborated and strengthened the petitioners' claim that they are co-owners of the Corregidor Property. Moreover, it ruled against Norma's contention that she and Oscar never transferred the property to Maria after it was awarded to them by the NHA because of the existence of a registered title in the name of Maria.[60] The RTC concluded that the transfer to Oscar was simulated, hence he did not become the owner of the Corregidor Property even after the issuance of a title in his name. Since respondents were not able to establish why Maria's title was cancelled and a new one was issued in favor of Oscar, then there is merit in the petitioners' claim that the transfer was merely for the purpose of securing a loan. Also, the fact that Oscar demanded contributions from the petitioners for the loan amortizations, insurance, and taxes negates the contention that the latter were just renting the property.[61] Aggrieved, respondents appealed to the CA.[62] Ruling of the Court of Appeals In a Decision[63] dated November 25, 2022, the CA reversed the RTC ruling. The fallo thereof reads: WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated 29 July 2019 of the Regional Trial Court, National Capital Judicial Region, Branch 222, Quezon City in Civil Case No. R-QZN-14-00363-CV cancelling TCT No. RT-125152 (369284) in the name of defendants-appellants Spouses Oscar and Norma NuÃ±ez is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Complaint for Annulment of Title and other Documents, Reconveyance, Damages and Attorney's Fees in Civil Case No. R-QZN-14-00363-CV is DISMISSED. SO ORDERED.[64] (Emphasis in the original) The CA held that material contradictions casted doubt on the reliability of the photocopy of Maria's title. The petitioners failed to sufficiently explain the circumstances leading to the loss or destruction of the owner's duplicate original copy of TCT No. 262412. In any case, despite its admission as evidence by the RTC, the CA clarified that admissibility should not be equated with weight of evidence. Therefore, the RTC erred in giving credence to the incomplete single-page photocopy of TCT No. 262412.[65] Also, the petitioners failed to present any evidence, other than their self-serving claim, that Maria had no intention of divesting herself of ownership over the Corregidor Property. Meanwhile, the respondents were able to substantiate their ownership by presenting the documents from NHA and TCT No. RT-125152. Ultimately, the petitioners failed to overcome the strong presumption of validity in favor of Oscar's title.[66] The petitioners sought reconsideration,[67] but it was denied by the CA in a Resolution[68] dated April 28, 2023. Hence, this petition. Issue Did the CA commit a reversible error in discrediting Maria's title? Our Ruling The petition is denied. Foremost, We emphasize that a petition for review on certiorari is a remedy under the law confined to settle questions of law and not questions of facts. However, the Court may take an exception thereto when the findings of the CA are contrary to those of the trial court, as in this case.[69] After a judicious review of the records, We find that petitioners failed to prove that the Corregidor Property was owned by their mother, Maria. Consequently, there is no basis for their claim that it is co-owned. In civil cases, the party having the burden of proof must establish his or her case by preponderance of evidence. This is satisfied when the evidence adduced by one side is, as a whole, superior to or has greater weight than that of the other. Bare allegations, unsubstantiated by evidence, are not equivalent to proof.[70] In Spouses Yabut v. Alcantara,[71] the Court explained the nature of an action for reconveyance: An action for reconveyance is a legal and equitable remedy that seeks to transfer or reconvey property, wrongfully registered in another person's name, to its rightful owner. To warrant reconveyance of the land, the plaintiff must allege and prove, among others, ownership of the land in dispute and the defendant's erroneous, fraudulent or wrongful registration of the property.[72] The following requisites must concur: (1) the action must be brought in the name of a person claiming ownership or dominical right over the land registered in the name of the defendant; (2) the registration of the land in the name of the defendant was procured through fraud or other illegal means; (3) the property has not yet passed to an innocent purchaser for value; and (4) the action is filed after the certificate of title had already become final and incontrovertible but within four years from the discovery of the fraud, or not later than ten [10] years in the case of an implied trust.[73] (Citations omitted) Here, the first requisite was complied with since the action for reconveyance was brought in the name of petitioners who are claiming ownership over the Corregidor Property that is currently registered in the name of respondent Oscar. The same holds true for the third requisite as the property has not yet passed to an innocent purchaser for value. As regards the fourth requisite, the Court has, by way of exception, permitted the filing of an action for reconveyance despite the lapse of more than 10 years from the issuance of the title in cases where the plaintiffs were in actual possession of the disputed land.[74] In this case, Oscar's title was issued in 1987, while the subject complaint was filed only in 2014. However, it is undisputed that the petitioners are in actual possession of the Corregidor Property. Therefore, the action is not barred by prescription. Despite the foregoing, the action must fail since the petitioners were not able to satisfy the second requisite. The main evidence submitted by the petitioners to prove Maria's ownership is the photocopy of the first page of TCT No. 262412 under her name. Under the Rules on Evidence, a duplicate is admissible to the same extent as an original unless (1) a genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the original, or (2) in the circumstances, it is unjust or inequitable to admit the duplicate in lieu of the original.[75] Further, when the original document has been lost or destroyed, or cannot be produced in court, the offeror, upon proof of its execution or existence and the cause of its unavailability without bad faith on his or her part, may prove its contents by a copy, or by recital of its contents in some authentic document, or by the testimony of witnesses in the order stated.[76] In Lee v. People,[77] the Court elucidated: The offeror of secondary evidence is burdened to prove the predicates thereof: (a) the loss or destruction of the original without bad faith on the part of the proponent/offeror which can be shown by circumstantial evidence of routine practices of destruction of documents; (b) the proponent must prove by a fair preponderance of evidence as to raise a reasonable inference of the loss or destruction of the original copy; and (c) it must be shown that a diligent and bona fide but unsuccessful search has been made for the document in the proper place or places. It has been held that where the missing document is the foundation of the action, more strictness in proof is required than where the document is only collaterally involved.[78] (Citations omitted) Here, the respondents have repeatedly questioned the admissibility of the photocopy of the first page of TCT No. 262412. To counter this, Conrado, Jr. explained in his Judicial Affidavit:[79] Q: I noticed that Transfer Certificate of Title No. 262412 is a photocopy, where is the original of this? A: I do not have the original copy, sir. Q: What efforts, if any, did you exert in looking for the original of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 262412? A: I tried my very best and exerted my best efforts to locate the original of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 262412 in our house but I cannot locate the same. I sent somebody to ask for a certified true copy from the Register of Deeds of Quezon City but was issued a certification to the effect that the original of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 262412 was not among those saved titles during the fire that razed the Quezon City Hall Building on June 11, 1988...[80] On cross-examination, Conrado, Jr. stated: Q: Despite this registration under the name of the spouses you claimed that the real owner of the real property to be Maria NuÃ±ez and not the registered owners and you supported this claim by a one[-]page photocopy of Maria NuÃ±ez supposed title, is this correct? A: The title of Norma and Oscar NuÃ±ez was derived from the title of my mother, ma'am. Q: Mr. Witness, my only question is, other than the registered owners you still claimed that it is your mother, Maria NuÃ±ez, who owned the property by presenting a photocopy of her supposed title, is this correct? A: Yes, ma'am. Q: When for the first time have you seen this one-page photocopy of the alleged title of Maria NuÃ±ez? A: First time? Q: Yes, Mr. Witness. A: Ito na pong maghe-hearing na tayo, nahalungkat ko iyon sa papeles ng mother ko, ma'am. [Q]: Now, Mr. Witness, have you or anyone in your family ever saw the original owner's duplicate title of Maria NuÃ±ez? A: I don't have knowledge about that, ma'am.[81] . . . . Q: Now, Mr. Witness, with respect to your claim that the real owner of property in 20 Corregidor Street is your mother and to support your claim you presented a one-page photocopy of her supposed title. I asked you previously when was the first time you've seen that photocopy and you said it was only during the filing of the case, correct, Mr. Witness? A: Yes, ma'am. Q: And that no one among your family members ever saw the original copy of the owner's duplicate of the title of Maria NuÃ±ez, correct, Mr. Witness? A: Yes, ma'am. Q: Do you know more or less when it was awarded to her, Mr. Witness? A: I don't know, ma'am.[82] On the other hand, Mary Claire Masangkay, Maria's granddaughter, testified: Q: How did you know that [Maria] is the owner of the Corregidor Property? A: As far as I know she owned the property because she used to tell me that she's the one who was pursuing everything, the documentary process to acquire that property. It was her who did the processing and the title of the property was in her possession, ma'am. Q: So, Madam Witness, your only basis then is because it's your grandmother who pursued all the follow-ups, because of that [sic] follow-ups that she was making you came to believe that she is the owner, is that correct? A: Yes, ma' am. And at the time she also mentioned that she also had a title, which I know that she indeed has during that time, ma'am. Q: Now, you're telling me that she has the title. What is this title all about? Have you seen the tittle [sic], original title, that you are talking about? A: At that time, I was only about 5 or 7 years so I have not seen that title she was referring to, ma'am.[83] Additionally, Josefina T. Padilla, Maria's relative and close friend, testified: Q: So Madame Witness with respect to the property that is being controverted now which is in 20 Corregidor Street, Bago Bantay, Quezon City and you said you are very much aware of this property? A: Yes, ma'am. Q: Who owns this property? A: I know it [is] Tiya Maring because the children are still small, mga nag-aaral pa po sila eh kaya si Tiya Maring talaga ang may-ari nung... siya and nag-ano niyan, nag-aplay. Q: Do you have any proof that indeed or have you seen any proof, document or any evidence that would show that Maria NuÃ±ez is the owner of this property? A: I have not seen any proof but I know in my he that she is the owner of the property, ma'am.[84] While the alleged loss of the original of TCT No. 262412 may have been supported by the Certification[85] dated December 6, 2013 from the RD of Quezon City, still, the foregoing testimonies failed to raise any reasonable inference of the loss or destruction of the owner's duplicate original copy of TCT No. 262412. There is also no showing that a diligent and bona fide but unsuccessful search has been made for the document in the proper places. Thus, the RTC erred in admitting it as evidence. Even assuming that admission was proper, We stress that admissibility should not be equated with probative value or weight of evidence. In Mancol, Jr. v. Development Bank of the Philippines,[86] the Court explained: 'The admissibility of evidence depends on its relevance and competence, while the weight of evidence pertains to evidence already admitted and its tendency to convince and persuade.' The admissibility of a particular item of evidence has to do with whether it meets various tests by which its reliability is to be determined, so as to be considered with other evidence admitted in the case in arriving at a decision as to the truth. The weight of evidence is not determined mathematically by the numerical superiority of the witnesses testifying to a given fact, but depends upon its practical effect in inducing belief on the part of the judge trying the case. 'Admissibility refers to the question of whether certain pieces of evidence are to be considered at all, while probative value refers to the question of whether the admitted evidence proves an issue.' 'Thus, a particular item of evidence may be admissible, but its evidentiary weight depends on judicial evaluation within the guidelines provided by the rules of evidence.'[87] (Citations omitted) The petitioners insist that the RTC was correct in ruling in favor of the authenticity and existence of the original copy of TCT No. 262412 because Oscar's title indicates that it was derived therefrom.[88] From this, the RTC concluded that the transfer to Oscar was simulated, and that the sole purpose of such transfer was for the loan application. In addition, the RTC faulted the respondents for not being able to establish why Maria's title was cancelled and a new one was issued in favor of Oscar. We do not agree. To stress, the burden of proof was on the petitioners to prove that the Corregidor Property is co-owned, and not on the respondents to prove that they are the owners thereof. In any event, a scrutiny of the records reveals that the pieces of evidence preponderate in favor of the respondents. The certificate of title in the name of Oscar serves as evidence of his indefeasible and incontrovertible title to the Corregidor Property. It is conclusive evidence with respect to the ownership of the land described therein.[89] Too, not only were respondents able to present the original copy of TCT No. RT-125152, they also submitted the following documents to prove how they acquired the Corregidor Property: (1) Compromise Agreement[90] dated November 10, 1975 between Oscar and the NHA; (2) PHHC Passbook No. 15118[91] under the name of Oscar; (3) Deed of Sale[92] dated June 14, 1977 between PHHC and Oscar; (4) transmittal letter[93] from the NHA in favor of Oscar; and (5) NHA Certification[94] dated May 15, 2014 which states: This is to certify that according to our records, OSCAR NUÃEZ married to NORMA NUÃEZ is the awardee of Lot 02 Block 5, Psd-04-00898, located at North Bago Bantay Project, Quezon City with an area of 243.50 square meters, more or less.[95] Contrary to the RTC, what the Court finds to be lacking is the supporting document on how Maria obtained her alleged title over the property in 1979 after the same was awarded to Oscar in 1977. Conrado, Jr. stated in his judicial affidavit: Q: Do you know how was the legal title transferred by your mother to your brother, Oscar NuÃ±ez? A: I learned that they signed a document of transfer/deed of sale which was simulated because the transfer of the said property would only be for the purpose of securing a loan to develop it. There was even no payment of any consideration for the transfer. Q: Do you have a copy of this document of transfer/deed of sale? A: I have no copy, sir, because the original copy is in the possession of my brother.[96] Conversely, Norma denied signing any document to transfer the Corregidor Property to Maria: Q: Now Madame Witness with respect to the title that was presented to you, it was shown that title ending in '52' is set to have preceded from a title allegedly owned by Maria NuÃ±ez. Do you remember of any instance from the time you have the property under your name that you executed any document that could cause such transfer? A: I am absolutely sure that I have not issued or I have not signed any document or any deed of sale to transfer our ownership to Maria NuÃ±ez. Even Oscar doesn't have, he did not sign any document to that effect, that's why I am very sure that whatever was stated at the xerox copy of title of Maria NuÃ±ez cannot be relied upon because it's only a xerox copy or it's only a photocopy, so how can we be...[97] The Court holds that petitioners' unsubstantiated and self-serving claims do not hold water against the overwhelming pieces of evidence presented by respondents. In a last-ditch attempt to salvage their case, the petitioners contend that this Court should reiterate the CA's finding in its Decision[98] in CA-G.R. SP No. 148484 regarding the previous unlawful detainer case between the parties, specifically the following: To be sure, the best proof of ownership of the land is the TCT. Hence, more than a bare allegation is required to defeat the face value of petitioners' TCT, which enjoys the legal presumption of regularity of issuance. Here, the allegations of respondents are supported by preponderant evidence. If petitioners were the original owners of the subject property, then why does their reconstituted title TCT No. RT-125152 trace back to TCT No. 262412 corresponding to the TCT of Maria Nunez? This reinforces respondents' claim that the subject property was indeed an inheritance from Maria and that petitioner Oscar and respondents became co-owners of the subject property by operation of law upon Maria's death, being the latter's compulsory heirs. . . . . The strongest evidence, however, that leads us to conclude that a co-ownership exists between petitioner Oscar and the respondents is the fact that respondents shared in the payments of the loan amortizations, the house insurance premiums, and real estate taxes. While it is true that the contributions made by respondents were unequal, the reason behind this was sufficiently explained by respondents when they related that Oscar only started collecting their share in 1989 because prior to the transfer of the title in his and Norma's names in 1989, it was their mother Maria who was paying the real estate taxes for the subject property. Notably, it was the act of sharing in these payments which led the RTC to conclude that there exists a co-ownership between petitioner Oscar and respondents over the subject property. Since petitioner Oscar and the respondents are co-owners of the subject property, petitioners cannot eject respondents therefrom.[99] (Citations omitted) We emphasize however, that petitioners conveniently omitted m their petition the immediately succeeding caveat from the CA's ruling: It is, nonetheless, emphasized that any pronouncement made by the lower courts on the issue of ownership of the subject lot is merely provisional in nature. The provisional determination of ownership in this ejectment case cannot be clothed with finality.[100] (Citations o",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itted) Indeed," it is well-settled that """"the sole issue for resolution in ejectment case[s] relates to the physical or material possession of the property involved", independent of the claim of ownership by any of the parties. Even if the question of ownership is raised in the pleadings, as in the case at bench, the courts may pass upon such issue but only to determine the issue of possession especially if the former is inseparably linked with the latter. In any case, the adjudication of ownership, being merely provisional," does not bar or prejudice an action between the parties involving title to the subject property.""""[101] We now proceed to the respondents' claim for moral damages", exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.[102] In Singson v. Spouses Carpio,[103] the Court held: Moral damages are recoverable only if the party from whom it is claimed has acted fraudulently or in bad faith or in wanton disregard of his/her contractual obligations. Bad faith, on the other hand, does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence, but imports a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong, a breach of known duty through some motive or interest or ill will that partakes of the nature of fraud. . . . . [T]he award of moral damages must be anchored on a clear showing that mental anguish, besmirched reputation, sleepless nights, wounded feelings, or similar injury was actually experienced[.][104] (Citations omitted) Whereas, exemplary damages is allowed only in addition to moral damages such that it cannot be awarded unless the claimant first establishes his or her clear right to moral damages.[105] Anent the award of attorney's fees," """"[t]he general rule is that [it] cannot be recovered as part of damages because of the policy that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate. Being the exception rather than the rule", an award of such fees requires compelling reason before it may be granted. Even when a claimant is compelled to bring his/her cause to court or incur expenses to protect his/her rights," attorney's fees still may not be awarded as part of damages where no sufficient showing of bad faith could be reflected in a party's persistence in a case other than an erroneous conviction of the righteousness of its cause.""""[106] We reproduce the pertinent parts of Norma's judicial affidavit: 43.Q: What did you and Oscar feel when this case was filed by the plaintiffs against you? A: It is a complete let-down that our generosity will be repaid this way. For the last 37 years that my husband and I allowed his siblings to make use of the Bago Bantay property", while me and my children had to reside in the flood-prone area in Pasay City, so that Oscar's siblings can stay in a decent house, the realization is too painful causing us including my children sleepless nights, mental anxiety, besmirched reputation as we are depicted as land-grabber around the community. 44.Q: If you are to quantify this heartache, agony, mental anxiety and besmirched reputation that your own family is suffering, how much would that be? A: [PHP] 500,000.00 for myself and Oscar and for my three children at [PHP] 100,000.00 each, who are unwittingly getting involved.[107] Meanwhile, on Norma's cross-examination: Q: You also stated in your judicial affidavit that you are claiming damages for your children? A: Yes, sir. Q: But you would confirm Ms. Witness that your children are not parties to this case? Not parties to this case? A: In a way they are, sir. Q: But in a way they are? A: Yes because it is their interest that is at stake. Q: But you would at least confirm Ms. Witness that the only defendants in this case are you and your husband, is it not? A: Yes but we are a family, sir. Q: But your children were never impleaded or made parties in this case, is it not? A: Yes only the [two] of us, sir. Q: Now Ms. Witness do you have any sleeping disorder? A: Yes I have, sir. Q: So prior to this case, you already have a sleeping disorder? A: It has been aggravated by this case, sir. Q: So prior there's already an existing sleeping disorder on your part? A: Not exactly. It's just but natural for a busy person like me to have some sleeping disorder but with this case, it was aggravated, sir. Q: But you can still sleep? A: With the help of some medicines, sir. Q: Even your husband? A: My husband is in the United States, sir. Q: So you do not know if he is suffering from sleepless nights because he is in the United States? A: Well as he is claiming, he is totally affected by this case, sir.[108] Then, on re-direct examination: Q: Now Madame Witness on cross also, you are claiming in behalf of your children. What is your basis considering that they were not parties to this complaint? A: I can say na sabi ko nga, we are a family, ang sakit ng kalingkingan, sakit ng buong katawan. Now my children were also so much affected and the relationship was restrained [sic]. They used to be very happy and now it's restrained [sic] dahil nga sa kaso na ito. Dahil sa kasong ito, nakakalungkot, nalulungkot sila at nasasaktan everytime because I reported to them always lahat ng mga bagay-bagay na nagaganap sa kaso na ito and nasasaktan sila dahil nasasabihan ako na ako ay sinungaling, ako ay greedy. Para sa akin, sila ay nasasaktan dahil iyon naman ay hindi totoo. Q: Now with respect to your husband. On cross, you were asked that your husband is residing in United States. How come you are familiar with the suffering that he has suffered because of this case? A: Alam na alam ko ang nangyayari sa kanya doon sa Amerika. In this modern time, communication is too easy. We have an access to communication. Halos araw-araw or every week nag-uusap kami via Skype, via Viber, whatever. He was crying out loud to me kung gaano siya nasasaktan dahil sabi nga niya, sila ang kaniyang buhay. Ginawa niya ang lahat para sila ay matulungan and at the end, this is what he gets, ang masaktan pang labis.[109] The foregoing statements, without more, do not justify the award of the damages prayed for. Even assuming that Norma's predicaments are true, still, she failed to show that the petitioners acted in bad faith, and that their actuations were the proximate cause of her alleged suffering. Moreover, she merely conveyed that her sleepless nights and mental anxiety, among others, were anchored from the stress brought about by the present case. To Our mind, this is not unusual given the apparent strained relations between the parties. Besides, it is a basic rule in evidence that witnesses can testify only on facts that they know of their own personal knowledge, i.e., those which are derived from their own perception. Personal knowledge is a substantive prerequisite for accepting testimonial evidence that establishes the truth of a disputed fact.[110] In the present case, Norma's narrations with regard to the suffering of Oscar, and her children who were not impleaded, are inadmissible for being hearsay. Hence, for lack of factual and legal bases, the award of moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees is unwarranted. ACCORDINGLY, the petition is DENIED.

"A.C. No. 13435 (Formerly CBD Case No. 18-5815) - DENIS GUY MARTIN, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. LETICIA E. ALA, RESPONDENT. D E C I S I O N - Supreme Court E-Library","A.C. No. 13435 (Formerly CBD Case No. 18-5815) DENIS GUY MARTIN, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. LETICIA E. ALA, RESPONDENT. February 05, 2025","The Facts Complainant, a French national, was married to respondent's sister, Rebecca E. Ala-Martin (Rebecca). In 1992, complainant and Rebecca separated legally. Thereafter, the couple filed cases against each other, with respondent representing her sister Rebecca.[2] Sometime in 2006, complainant filed a Complaint for disbarment against respondent for allegedly representing conflicting interests and for using abusive and offensive language, titled Martin v. Atty. Ala and docketed as CBD Case No. 06-1846. The IBP Investigating Commissioner, as adopted and approved by the IBP Board of Governors, eventually found respondent administratively liable and, accordingly, recommended her suspension from the practice of law for two months. Respondent's subsequent Motion for Reconsideration was denied by the IBP Board of Governors in a Resolution dated September 20, 2008.[3] Thereafter, sometime in January 2017, respondent filed a Complaint for deportation (as Undesirable Alien) against complainant before the Bureau of Immigration (BI). Subsequently, on April 17, 2017, an apparent altercation occurred between respondent and complainant's son/respondent's nephew, Jean Marc. Because of these incidents, complainant filed the instant Complaint for disbarment against respondent.[4] Particularly, complainant charged respondent with attempted murder and with violating the Lawyer's Oath, as well as Rules 1.01 and 1.02 of Canon 1 of the CPR for allegedly ordering the responding police officers during the incident on April 17, 2017 to shoot or kill Jean Marc, respondent's nephew. Complainant likewise charged respondent with violating Canon 15, Rule 15.03 of the CPR for representing conflicting interests in connection with the deportation case she filed against the former. In this respect, complainant claimed that respondent used information previously obtained when she, through her law firm, was a counsel for the Drilling & Blasting Management Group, Inc., of which Rebecca was the President, albeit, complainant did not clarify his exact relation to the said company.[5] Finally, complainant asserted that respondent continues to use abusive and offensive language in her pleadings despite the previous sanction and warning given by the Court in A.C. No. 10556, in violation of Canon 8, Rule 8.01 of the CPR.[6] In defense, respondent denied all the allegations against her and claimed that the previous case against her, A.C. No. 10556, is still pending before the Court.[7] The IBP Proceedings In a Report and Recommendation[8] dated September 13, 2019, the IBP Investigating Commissioner (IC) found respondent guilty of employing offensive and improper language in her pleadings and, accordingly, recommended that respondent be admonished, with a stem warning that a repetition of the same or similar offense shall be dealt with more severely.[9] The IBP-IC found respondent administratively liable for violating Canon 1, Rule 1.0 of the CPR and the Lawyer's Oath for repeatedly urging the police officers to shoot her nephew, Jean Marc, during the April 17, 2017 incident. The IBP-IC, however, noted that when respondent ordered the same, she was under distress due to Jean Marc's actions and thus, betrayed the lack of any. apparent intention on her part to commit a wrong.[10] In the same vein, the IBP-IC found respondent liable for violating Canon 8, Rule 8.01 of the CPR for using abusive and offensive words in her various submissions before the BI in the deportation case.[11] The foregoing notwithstanding, the IBP-IC found no merit in complainant's claim that respondent is guilty of representing conflicting interests in connection with the deportation case. The IBP-IC held that conflict of interest does not exist when it is the lawyer themself that files the case against their former client, as in this case. Moreover, the IBP-IC noted that the record failed to indicate that there was any confidential information which respondent may have acquired from her previous representation of complainant which she used in filing the deportation case.[12] Parenthetically, however, the IBP-IC did not consider the findings in CBD Case No. 06-1846, noting that the same is still pending before the Court.[13] In a Resolution[14] dated June 12, 2021, the IBP Board of Governors (IBP Board) resolved to approve and adopt the Report and Recommendation of the IC. Dissatisfied, complainant moved for reconsideration, arguing that the findings in CBD Case No. 06-1846 should be considered in the resolution of the present case and respondent should be disbarred in view of the gravity of her administrative infractions.[15] In a Resolution[16] dated February 25, 2022, the IBP Board upheld with modification the June 12, 2021 Resolution, finding respondent guilty of violating Canons 1 and 8 of the CPR, and accordingly, recommended the penalty of reprimand with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar offense shall be dealt with more severely. In the interim, the Court adopted the IBP's Report and Recommendation, with modification, in A.C. No. 10556 (formerly CBD Case No. 06-1846), in a Resolution dated June 30, 2021. Consequently, respondent was admonished and sternly warned that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely. The Issue Before the Court The issue before the Court is whether respondent should be held administratively liable for the acts complained of.","The suspension from the practice of law shall take effect immediately upon receipt of this Decision. Atty. Leticia E. Ala is DIRECTED to immediately file a Manifestation to the Court that her suspension has started stating the exact date of receipt of this Decision, copy furnished all courts and quasi-judicial bodies where she has entered her appearance as counsel.

I At the outset, it is important to note that on April 11, 2023, the Court En Banc unanimously approved A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC or the ""Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability"" (CPRA), repealing the CPR, Sections 20 to 37 of Rule 138, and Rule 139-B of the Rules of Court. Section 3 of the General Provisions of the CPRA states that it ""shall take effect fifteen (15) calendar days after its publication in the Official Gazette or any newspaper of general circulation."" The CPRA was published in the Philippine Star and Manila Bulletin on May 14, 2023 and hence, already effective on May 30, 2023.[17] In this relation, Section 1 of the General Provisions of the CPRA states that it ""shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except to the extent that in the opinion of the [Court], its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern."" In view of the foregoing, the Court shall resolve this case under the framework of the CPRA, to the extent that it is applicable. II Time and again, the Court has emphasized that the practice of law is imbued with public interest and that a lawyer owes substantial duties, not only to their client, but also to their brethren in the profession, to the courts, and to the public, and takes part in the administration of justice, one of the most important functions of the State, as an officer of the court. Accordingly, lawyers are bound to maintain, not only a high standard of legal proficiency, but also of morality, honesty, integrity, and fair dealing.[18] Indeed, it is settled that the practice of law is not a right, but a privilege bestowed by the State on those who show that they possess, and continue to possess, the qualifications required by law for the conferment of such privilege. To this end, a member of the legal fraternity should refrain from doing any act which might lessen in any degree the confidence and trust reposed by the public in the fidelity, honesty, and integrity of the legal profession.[19] Accordingly, lawyers may be disciplined for any conduct, whether in their professional or in their private capacity, if such conduct renders them unfit to continue to be officers of the court.[20] In this regard, Canon II of the CPRA requires lawyers to always act with propriety and maintain the appearance of propriety in personal and professional dealings, observe honesty, respect and courtesy, and uphold the dignity of the legal profession consistent with the highest standards of ethical behavior. It pertinently reads: CANON II PROPRIETY A lawyer shall at all times, act with propriety and maintain the appearance of propriety in personal and professional dealings, observe honesty, respect and courtesy, and uphold the dignity of the legal profession consistent with the highest standards of ethical behavior. SECTION 2. Dignified conduct. â A lawyer shall respect the law, the courts, tribunals, and other government agencies, their officials, employees, and processes, and act with courtesy, civility, fairness, and candor towards fellow members of the bar. A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on one's fitness to practice law, nor behave in a scandalous manner, whether in public or private life, to the discredit of the legal profession. SECTION 4. Use of dignified, gender-fair, and child- and culturally-sensitive language. â A lawyer shall use only dignified, gender-fair, and child- and culturallyÂ­-sensitive language in all personal and professional dealings. To this end, a lawyer shall not use language which is abusive, intemperate, offensive or otherwise improper, oral or written, and whether made through traditional or electronic means, including all forms or types of mass or social media. SECTION 6. Harassing or threatening conduct. â A lawyer shall not harass or threaten a fellow lawyer, the latter's client or principal, a witness, or any official or employee of a court, tribunal, or other government agency. SECTION 13. Imputation of a misconduct, impropriety, or crime without basis. â A lawyer shall not, directly or indirectly, impute to or accuse another lawyer of misconduct, impropriety, or a crime in the absence of factual or legal basis. (Emphasis supplied) In addition, Canon III mandates lawyers to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the land, promote respect for laws and legal processes, assist in the administration of justice as an officer of the court, safeguard human rights, and always advance the honor and integrity of the legal profession. It relevantly states: CANON III FIDELITY Fidelity pertains to a lawyer's duty to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the land, to assist in the administration of justice as an officer of the court, and to advance or defend the client's cause, with full devotion, genuine interest, and zeal in the pursuit of truth and justice. . . . . SECTION 2. The responsible and accountable lawyer. â A lawyer shall uphold the constitution, obey the laws of the land, promote respect for laws and legal processes, safeguard human rights, and at all times advance the honor and integrity of the legal profession. Lastly, Canon III of the same Code proscribes lawyers from representing conflicting interests, except by written informed consent of all concerned given after a full disclosure of the facts.[21] Applying the foregoing precepts, the Court agrees with the IBP that respondent should be held administratively liable. III Unlawful conduct The Court agrees with the IBP that respondent should be held administratively liable in connection with her conduct during the April 17, 2017 incident. As the IBP astutely observed, respondent urged the responding police officers to shoot her nephew, Jean Marc, several times despite the police officers' refusal to heed her instructions in view of existing legal and police procedures. To quote pertinent portions of the exchanges between respondent and the police officers, as narrated in the April 18, 2017 Affidavit of Arrest of PO3 Trivar Valena y Dela Cruz: "". . . Ang sabi ni [respondent] sa amin ay: 'For God's sake! Patayin niyo na si Jean Marc! Barilin nyo na kesa tayo pa ang maunahan niya dito! Simple target hindi niyo pa magawang barilin?!' . . . Ma'am hindi po ganun kadali ang pinapagawa niyo! Unang una eh wala pa naman po ginagawang hakbang si Jean Marc para gawin namin ang gusto niyo! Tsaka kailangan pa po naming isangguni iyon sa aming Hepe! Pag nagka imbestigasyonpo eh kami pa and makakasuhan ng Murder sa gusto niyong mangyari!' agad naman itong sumagot sa amin na: 'Bakit inaalala niyo ang Complainant? Wala naman complainant! Kami?! Hindi naman kami magcocomplain kaya barilin niyo na at naghahanap nalang iyan ng damay! . . . ""Ano ba? Bakit hindi niyo pa barilin! Patayin niyo na! Ano ba!'. . . 'Anu Ba? Barilin niyo na! kahit sa paa niyo lang patamaan para hindi na siya makatakas pa! dahil dadalhin naming siya agad agad sa Metro Psych doon namin siya ilalagay para hindi na siya makalabas doon . . .""[22] As an officer of the court, it behooved respondent to ensure that the Constitution and the laws, including legal processes, are observed not only in her conduct and dealings with others, but also by those around her. Indeed, the CPRA requires lawyers to ""uphold the constitution, obey the laws of the land, promote respect for laws and legal processes, safeguard human rights, and at all times advance the honor and integrity of the legal profession.""[23] It also proscribes lawyers from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on their fitness to practice law, and behaving in a scandalous manner, whether in public or private life, to the discredit of the legal profession.[24] Verily, respondent's actuations in this case demonstrate a conscious disrespect of the laws and legal processes in repeatedly pressing the responding police officers to shoot Jean Marc despite the apparent absence of any cause to warrant such police action. Worse, her actions betrayed a marked disregard for her nephew's basic right not to be deprived of life and liberty without due process of the law. On this score, the Court notes the IBP's observation that there appeared to have been no manifest and deliberate intention on the part of respondent to commit a wrong when she repeatedly instructed the police officers to shoot Jean Marc.[25] Indeed, under the circumstances, it can hardly be doubted that respondent may have been impelled by strong emotions of fear and/or distress and the need to protect her family, especially since it appeared that it was not the first instance that Jean Marc's actions caused police officers to respond. Certainly, the Court will not feign comprehension of all the complex and varied reactions any person may have in such situations. Nonetheless, as an officer of the court, respondent is charged with the duty to refrain from doing any act which might lessen in any degree the confidence and trust reposed by the public in the fidelity, honesty, and integrity of the legal profession. Lawyers must at all times uphold and respect the laws and its processes. As such, it behooved respondent to observe a greater degree of prudence and circumspection in her actions and words at all times, gravely failing in which will warrant administrative sanction. Use of intemperate or abusive language In the same vein, the Court agrees that respondent should be held liable for using intemperate and abusive language. It cannot be denied that the adversarial nature of our legal system has tempted members of the Bar to use strong language in pursuit of their duty to advance the interests of their clients.[26] Nonetheless, while a lawyer is entitled to present their case with vigor and courage, such enthusiasm does not justify the use of offensive and abusive language. Language abounds with countless possibilities for one to be emphatic but respectful, convincing but not derogatory, and illuminating but not offensive.[27] The use of intemperate language and unkind ascriptions has no place in the dignity of the judicial forum.[28] In this case, as the IBP aptly noted and summarized, respondent essentially accused complainant and his counsel of tampering with records; questioned complainant's dignity; and criticized complainant's counsel's knowledge of basic legal forms and of the laws in her submissions before the BI in the deportation case she filed against complainant, viz.: Pleadings filed before the BI[29] â¢ Verified Comment dated July 11, 2017 (par. 2.1): ""Herein Complainant will NOT take sitting down the FALSE and ABUSIVE ACCUSATIONS of BOTH herein Respondent and counsel; in their little minds, they both EQUATE herein Respondent's 'persona' AS THE SAME as that of Drilling @ Blasting Management Group, Inc."" â¢ Comment dated July 18, 2017 (par. 2): ""For all the braggadocio of herein Respondent Martin AND his counsel, it is noteworthy that said counsel does not even know FORMS of pleadings; moreover, after being told that herein Respondent INTENTIONALLY did NOT have his Counter-Affidavit CERTIFIED CORRECTLY in order NOT to be held for Perjury. They still continue to include a ""Certification Against Forum Shopping"" in BOTH herein Respondent Martin's Counter-Affidavit AND Memorandum, which under the Rules is ONLY required in INITIATORY pleadings, i.e., a COMPLAINT."" â¢ Motion for Reconsideration dated January 10, 2018 (pp. 8, 10, and 13): ""3.2.a With all due respect, the Resolution that dismissed this present case took an 'extremely parochial"" definition of 'undesirability.' The Undersigned Complainant found it extremely hard to respond politely to the Submissions of herein Respondent in this present case; one only has to read the pleadings of herein Respondent and be able to conclude that he has no 'decent bone' in himself and he had NO qualms making FALSE ALLEGATIONS in them."" ""(6.) Corrupting courts, prosecutors and other government entities, including TAMPERING with Court Records. There have been episodes how herein respondent, through his 'lawyer-operators' would intervene in Court processes, reversal of Resolutions adverse to herein Respondent but which did NOT succeed anyway, 'operating with adverse counsel/s' of REBECCA, the Heinous TAMPERING with resolutions, Court transcripts, etcetera . . . name it, herein Respondent has DONE IT."" ""(9.) Bragging about his lawyers-operators that can achieve EVRYTHING for him. Including repeatedly 'operating on adverse counsels'; etcetera."" â¢ Vigorous Reply dated January 30, 2018 (par. 5.2 and p. 8): ""Sometimes, the Undersigned Complainant wonders if herein Respondent's Counsel 'studied and trained' under the same Law Books as the Undersigned Complainant did study and train under at the University of the Philippines College of Law. What herein Respondent's good counsel does is what is called as 'tonsorial justice,' i.e., merely picking up parts of jurisprudence and the law that suit only its own pathetic views."" ""(6.) Corrupting courts, prosecutors and other government entities, including TAMPERING with Court Records. There have been episodes of how herein Respondent, through his 'lawyer-operators' would intervene in Court processes, reversal of Resolutions adverse to herein Respondent but which did NOT succeed anyway, 'operating with adverse counsel/s' of REBECCA, the Heinous TAMPERING with resolutions, Court transcripts, etcetera . . . name it, herein Respondent has DONE IT."" (Emphasis supplied) To the Court's mind, respondent's statements confirm her arrogance and manifest lack of restraint in the use and choice of her words constituting a clear violation of Canon II, Sections 4 and 13 of the CPRA. On numerous occasions, this Court has reminded members of the Bar to abstain from any offensive personality and to refrain from any act prejudicial to the honor or reputation of a party or a witness. In keeping with the dignity of the legal profession, a lawyer's language even in their pleadings, must be dignified,[30] failing in which, they must be held administratively liable, as in this case. Conflict of interest Finally, the Court likewise agrees with the IBP that respondent cannot be held liable for conflict of interest when she filed the deportation case against complainant. Broadly, conflict of interest exists when, in behalf of one client, it is the lawyers' duty to contend for that which duty to another client requires them to oppose.[31] It is of no moment that the lawyer would not be called upon to contend for one client that which the lawyer has to oppose for the other client, or that there would be no occasion to use the confidential information acquired from one to the disadvantage of the other as the two actions are wholly unrelated. It is enough that the opposing parties in one case, one of whom would lose the suit, are present clients and the nature or conditions of the lawyer's respective retainers with each of them would affect the performance of the duty of undivided fidelity to both clients.[32] In Gimeno v. Atty. Zaide,[33] the Court explained the tests to determine whether conflict of interest exists. The Court held: In Aninon v. Sabitsana, the Court laid down the tests to determine if a lawyer is guilty of representing conflicting interests between and among his clients. One of these tests is whether the acceptance of a new relation would prevent the full discharge of a lawyer's duty of undivided fidelity and loyalty to the client or invite suspicion of unfaithfulness or double-dealing in the performance of that duty. Another test is whether a lawyer would be called upon in the new relation to use against a former client any confidential information acquired through their connection or previous employment.[34] (Citations omitted; emphasis supplied) Based on the foregoing characterization, the rule on conflict of interest applies when a lawyer-client relationship exists, the purpose of which is to protect the fiduciary nature of the ties between an attorney and their client. Evidently, the rule finds no application when no such relationship exists, as when it is the lawyer themself that files the case against the former client involving no confidential information obtained from the latter. In this case, as the IBP aptly observed, respondent was representing herself and there was no indication that she used or abused any confidential information she may previously have acquired from complainant in prosecuting the deportation case. Under these circumstances, the Court holds that the evidence on record fails to support complainant's allegation that respondent is guilty of representing conflicting interests. It bears stressing that the burden of proof in disbarment proceedings rests upon the complainant to satisfactorily prove the allegations in his complaint through substantial evidence.[35] As far as the violation of the rule against conflict of interest is concerned, complainant failed in this regard. IV A member of the Bar found administratively liable for violating the Lawyer's Oath and/or breaching the ethics of the legal profession may be penalized, or even disbarred or suspended from their office as an attorney. The appropriate penalty on an errant lawyer depends on the exercise of sound judicial discretion based on the surrounding facts.[36] Under Canon VI, Section 34(a) and (m) of the CPRA, unlawful conduct and the use of intemperate or offensive language constitute less serious offenses, which under Section 37(b), would warrant the penalties of suspension from the practice of law, fine, or both: SECTION 37. Sanctions. â (b) If the respondent is found guilty of a less serious offense, any of the following sanctions, or a combination thereof, shall be imposed: (1) Suspension from the practice of law for a period within the range of one (1) month to six (6) months, or revocation of notarial commission and disqualification as a notary public for less than two years; (2) A fine within the range of PHP 35,000.00 to PHP 100,000.00. Meanwhile, under Canon VI, Section 39 of the CPRA, the presence of one or more aggravating circumstances and absence of any mitigating circumstances may justify the Court in imposing the penalties of suspension or fine for a period or amount not exceeding double the maximum prescribed therein. Relatedly, Section 38(b) of the CPRA enumerates the circumstances which the Court may consider as aggravating, which includes the finding of previous administrative liability where a penalty is imposed, regardless of nature or gravity. On this score, the Court is cognizant of respondent's previous administrative case, entitled Martin v. Atty. Ala, docketed as A.C. No. 10556, wherein she was found administratively liable for using offensive and improper language in her pleadings and was accordingly admonished. To the Court's mind, this prior finding of administrative infraction on respondent's part shows her propensity to disregard the CPRA and violate the Lawyer's Oath. Finally, Canon VI, Section 40 of the same Code provides that ""[i]f the respondent is found liable for more than one (1) offense arising from separate acts or omissions in a single administrative proceeding, the Court shall impose separate penalties for each offense."" Here, as discussed above, respondent violated the following provisions of the CPRA: (a) Canon II, Section 2 and Canon III, particularly Section 2, when she committed unlawful conduct during the April 17, 2017 incident; and (b) Canon II, Sections 4 and 13 when she used intemperate or abusive language in her submissions before the BI. The foregoing circumstances taken together, the Court deems it proper to impose upon respondent the following penalties: (i) suspension from the practice of law for six months for violating Canon II, Section 2 and Canon III, Section 2 of the CPRA; and (ii) suspension from the practice of law for one year for violating Canon II, Sections 4 and 13 of the CPRA. Further, respondent is sternly warned that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely. ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Atty. Leticia E. Ala GUILTY of violating the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA). She is hereby meted with the following penalties, which shall be served successively, pursuant to Section 34(h) and (m), in relation to Sections 38, 39, and 40 of the CPRA: (1) SUSPENSION from the practice of law for six months for violating Canon II, Section 2 and Canon III, Section 2 of the CPRA; and (2) SUSPENSION from the practice of law for one year for violating Canon II, Sections 4 and 13 of the CPRA. Further, she is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely. The suspension from the practice of law shall take effect immediately upon receipt of this Decision. Atty. Leticia E. Ala is DIRECTED to immediately file a Manifestation to the Court that her suspension has started stating the exact date of receipt of this Decision, copy furnished all courts and quasi-judicial bodies where she has entered her appearance as counsel. Let a copy of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant to be appended to Atty. Leticia E. Ala's personal record as an attorney, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for its information and guidance and the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all the courts. After completing her suspension, Atty. Leticia E. Ala shall file with the Office of the Bar Confidant a Sworn Statement pursuant to Section 45 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. SO ORDERED. Leonen, SAJ.

Mendoza, Second Division].","Sometime in 2006, complainant filed a Complaint for disbarment against respondent for allegedly representing conflicting interests and for using abusive and offensive language, titled Martin v. Atty. Ala and docketed as CBD Case No. 06-1846. The IBP Investigating Commissioner, as adopted and approved by the IBP Board of Governors, eventually found respondent administratively liable and, accordingly, recommended her suspension from the practice of law for two months. Respondent's subsequent Motion for Reconsideration was denied by the IBP Board of Governors in a Resolution dated September 20, 2008.[3] Thereafter, sometime in January 2017, respondent filed a Complaint for deportation (as Undesirable Alien) against complainant before the Bureau of Immigration (BI). Subsequently, on April 17, 2017, an apparent altercation occurred between respondent and complainant's son/respondent's nephew, Jean Marc. Because of these incidents, complainant filed the instant Complaint for disbarment against respondent.[4] Particularly, complainant charged respondent with attempted murder and with violating the Lawyer's Oath, as well as Rules 1.01 and 1.02 of Canon 1 of the CPR for allegedly ordering the responding police officers during the incident on April 17, 2017 to shoot or kill Jean Marc, respondent's nephew. Complainant likewise charged respondent with violating Canon 15, Rule 15.03 of the CPR for representing conflicting interests in connection with the deportation case she filed against the former. In this respect, complainant claimed that respondent used information previously obtained when she, through her law firm, was a counsel for the Drilling & Blasting Management Group, Inc., of which Rebecca was the President, albeit, complainant did not clarify his exact relation to the said company.[5] Finally, complainant asserted that respondent continues to use abusive and offensive language in her pleadings despite the previous sanction and warning given by the Court in A.C. No. 10556, in violation of Canon 8, Rule 8.01 of the CPR.[6] In defense, respondent denied all the allegations against her and claimed that the previous case against her, A.C. No. 10556, is still pending before the Court.[7] The IBP Proceedings In a Report and Recommendation[8] dated September 13, 2019, the IBP Investigating Commissioner (IC) found respondent guilty of employing offensive and improper language in her pleadings and, accordingly, recommended that respondent be admonished, with a stem warning that a repetition of the same or similar offense shall be dealt with more severely.[9] The IBP-IC found respondent administratively liable for violating Canon 1, Rule 1.0 of the CPR and the Lawyer's Oath for repeatedly urging the police officers to shoot her nephew, Jean Marc, during the April 17, 2017 incident. The IBP-IC, however, noted that when respondent ordered the same, she was under distress due to Jean Marc's actions and thus, betrayed the lack of any. apparent intention on her part to commit a wrong.[10] In the same vein, the IBP-IC found respondent liable for violating Canon 8, Rule 8.01 of the CPR for using abusive and offensive words in her various submissions before the BI in the deportation case.[11] The foregoing notwithstanding, the IBP-IC found no merit in complainant's claim that respondent is guilty of representing conflicting interests in connection with the deportation case. The IBP-IC held that conflict of interest does not exist when it is the lawyer themself that files the case against their former client, as in this case. Moreover, the IBP-IC noted that the record failed to indicate that there was any confidential information which respondent may have acquired from her previous representation of complainant which she used in filing the deportation case.[12] Parenthetically, however, the IBP-IC did not consider the findings in CBD Case No. 06-1846, noting that the same is still pending before the Court.[13] In a Resolution[14] dated June 12, 2021, the IBP Board of Governors (IBP Board) resolved to approve and adopt the Report and Recommendation of the IC. Dissatisfied, complainant moved for reconsideration, arguing that the findings in CBD Case No. 06-1846 should be considered in the resolution of the present case and respondent should be disbarred in view of the gravity of her administrative infractions.[15] In a Resolution[16] dated February 25, 2022, the IBP Board upheld with modification the June 12, 2021 Resolution, finding respondent guilty of violating Canons 1 and 8 of the CPR, and accordingly, recommended the penalty of reprimand with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar offense shall be dealt with more severely. In the interim, the Court adopted the IBP's Report and Recommendation, with modification, in A.C. No. 10556 (formerly CBD Case No. 06-1846), in a Resolution dated June 30, 2021. Consequently, respondent was admonished and sternly warned that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely. The Issue Before the Court The issue before the Court is whether respondent should be held administratively liable for the acts complained of. The Court's Ruling The Court resolves to adopt the findings and recommendation of the IBP, with modification as will be further discussed hereunder. I At the outset, it is important to note that on April 11, 2023, the Court En Banc unanimously approved A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC or the ""Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability"" (CPRA), repealing the CPR, Sections 20 to 37 of Rule 138, and Rule 139-B of the Rules of Court. Section 3 of the General Provisions of the CPRA states that it ""shall take effect fifteen (15) calendar days after its publication in the Official Gazette or any newspaper of general circulation."" The CPRA was published in the Philippine Star and Manila Bulletin on May 14, 2023 and hence, already effective on May 30, 2023.[17] In this relation, Section 1 of the General Provisions of the CPRA states that it ""shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except to the extent that in the opinion of the [Court], its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern."" In view of the foregoing, the Court shall resolve this case under the framework of the CPRA, to the extent that it is applicable. II Time and again, the Court has emphasized that the practice of law is imbued with public interest and that a lawyer owes substantial duties, not only to their client, but also to their brethren in the profession, to the courts, and to the public, and takes part in the administration of justice, one of the most important functions of the State, as an officer of the court. Accordingly, lawyers are bound to maintain, not only a high standard of legal proficiency, but also of morality, honesty, integrity, and fair dealing.[18] Indeed, it is settled that the practice of law is not a right, but a privilege bestowed by the State on those who show that they possess, and continue to possess, the qualifications required by law for the conferment of such privilege. To this end, a member of the legal fraternity should refrain from doing any act which might lessen in any degree the confidence and trust reposed by the public in the fidelity, honesty, and integrity of the legal profession.[19] Accordingly, lawyers may be disciplined for any conduct, whether in their professional or in their private capacity, if such conduct renders them unfit to continue to be officers of the court.[20] In this regard, Canon II of the CPRA requires lawyers to always act with propriety and maintain the appearance of propriety in personal and professional dealings, observe honesty, respect and courtesy, and uphold the dignity of the legal profession consistent with the highest standards of ethical behavior. It pertinently reads: CANON II PROPRIETY A lawyer shall at all times, act with propriety and maintain the appearance of propriety in personal and professional dealings, observe honesty, respect and courtesy, and uphold the dignity of the legal profession consistent with the highest standards of ethical behavior. SECTION 2. Dignified conduct. â A lawyer shall respect the law, the courts, tribunals, and other government agencies, their officials, employees, and processes, and act with courtesy, civility, fairness, and candor towards fellow members of the bar. A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on one's fitness to practice law, nor behave in a scandalous manner, whether in public or private life, to the discredit of the legal profession. SECTION 4. Use of dignified, gender-fair, and child- and culturally-sensitive language. â A lawyer shall use only dignified, gender-fair, and child- and culturallyÂ­-sensitive language in all personal and professional dealings. To this end, a lawyer shall not use language which is abusive, intemperate, offensive or otherwise improper, oral or written, and whether made through traditional or electronic means, including all forms or types of mass or social media. SECTION 6. Harassing or threatening conduct. â A lawyer shall not harass or threaten a fellow lawyer, the latter's client or principal, a witness, or any official or employee of a court, tribunal, or other government agency. SECTION 13. Imputation of a misconduct, impropriety, or crime without basis. â A lawyer shall not, directly or indirectly, impute to or accuse another lawyer of misconduct, impropriety, or a crime in the absence of factual or legal basis. (Emphasis supplied) In addition, Canon III mandates lawyers to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the land, promote respect for laws and legal processes, assist in the administration of justice as an officer of the court, safeguard human rights, and always advance the honor and integrity of the legal profession. It relevantly states: CANON III FIDELITY Fidelity pertains to a lawyer's duty to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the land, to assist in the administration of justice as an officer of the court, and to advance or defend the client's cause, with full devotion, genuine interest, and zeal in the pursuit of truth and justice. . . . . SECTION 2. The responsible and accountable lawyer. â A lawyer shall uphold the constitution, obey the laws of the land, promote respect for laws and legal processes, safeguard human rights, and at all times advance the honor and integrity of the legal profession. Lastly, Canon III of the same Code proscribes lawyers from representing conflicting interests, except by written informed consent of all concerned given after a full disclosure of the facts.[21] Applying the foregoing precepts, the Court agrees with the IBP that respondent should be held administratively liable. III Unlawful conduct The Court agrees with the IBP that respondent should be held administratively liable in connection with her conduct during the April 17, 2017 incident. As the IBP astutely observed, respondent urged the responding police officers to shoot her nephew, Jean Marc, several times despite the police officers' refusal to heed her instructions in view of existing legal and police procedures. To quote pertinent portions of the exchanges between respondent and the police officers, as narrated in the April 18, 2017 Affidavit of Arrest of PO3 Trivar Valena y Dela Cruz: "". . . Ang sabi ni [respondent] sa amin ay: 'For God's sake! Patayin niyo na si Jean Marc! Barilin nyo na kesa tayo pa ang maunahan niya dito! Simple target hindi niyo pa magawang barilin?!' . . .

Barilin niyo na! kahit sa paa niyo lang patamaan para hindi na siya makatakas pa! dahil dadalhin naming siya agad agad sa Metro Psych doon namin siya ilalagay para hindi na siya makalabas doon . . .""[22] As an officer of the court, it behooved respondent to ensure that the Constitution and the laws, including legal processes, are observed not only in her conduct and dealings with others, but also by those around her. Indeed, the CPRA requires lawyers to ""uphold the constitution, obey the laws of the land, promote respect for laws and legal processes, safeguard human rights, and at all times advance the honor and integrity of the legal profession.""[23] It also proscribes lawyers from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on their fitness to practice law, and behaving in a scandalous manner, whether in public or private life, to the discredit of the legal profession.[24] Verily, respondent's actuations in this case demonstrate a conscious disrespect of the laws and legal processes in repeatedly pressing the responding police officers to shoot Jean Marc despite the apparent absence of any cause to warrant such police action. Worse, her actions betrayed a marked disregard for her nephew's basic right not to be deprived of life and liberty without due process of the law. On this score, the Court notes the IBP's observation that there appeared to have been no manifest and deliberate intention on the part of respondent to commit a wrong when she repeatedly instructed the police officers to shoot Jean Marc.[25] Indeed, under the circumstances, it can hardly be doubted that respondent may have been impelled by strong emotions of fear and/or distress and the need to protect her family, especially since it appeared that it was not the first instance that Jean Marc's actions caused police officers to respond. Certainly, the Court will not feign comprehension of all the complex and varied reactions any person may have in such situations. Nonetheless, as an officer of the court, respondent is charged with the duty to refrain from doing any act which might lessen in any degree the confidence and trust reposed by the public in the fidelity, honesty, and integrity of the legal profession. Lawyers must at all times uphold and respect the laws and its processes. As such, it behooved respondent to observe a greater degree of prudence and circumspection in her actions and words at all times, gravely failing in which will warrant administrative sanction. Use of intemperate or abusive language In the same vein, the Court agrees that respondent should be held liable for using intemperate and abusive language. It cannot be denied that the adversarial nature of our legal system has tempted members of the Bar to use strong language in pursuit of their duty to advance the interests of their clients.[26] Nonetheless, while a lawyer is entitled to present their case with vigor and courage, such enthusiasm does not justify the use of offensive and abusive language. Language abounds with countless possibilities for one to be emphatic but respectful, convincing but not derogatory, and illuminating but not offensive.[27] The use of intemperate language and unkind ascriptions has no place in the dignity of the judicial forum.[28] In this case, as the IBP aptly noted and summarized, respondent essentially accused complainant and his counsel of tampering with records; questioned complainant's dignity; and criticized complainant's counsel's knowledge of basic legal forms and of the laws in her submissions before the BI in the deportation case she filed against complainant, viz.: Pleadings filed before the BI[29] â¢ Verified Comment dated July 11, 2017 (par. 2.1): ""Herein Complainant will NOT take sitting down the FALSE and ABUSIVE ACCUSATIONS of BOTH herein Respondent and counsel; in their little minds, they both EQUATE herein Respondent's 'persona' AS THE SAME as that of Drilling @ Blasting Management Group, Inc."" â¢ Comment dated July 18, 2017 (par. 2): ""For all the braggadocio of herein Respondent Martin AND his counsel, it is noteworthy that said counsel does not even know FORMS of pleadings; moreover, after being told that herein Respondent INTENTIONALLY did NOT have his Counter-Affidavit CERTIFIED CORRECTLY in order NOT to be held for Perjury. They still continue to include a ""Certification Against Forum Shopping"" in BOTH herein Respondent Martin's Counter-Affidavit AND Memorandum, which under the Rules is ONLY required in INITIATORY pleadings, i.e., a COMPLAINT."" â¢ Motion for Reconsideration dated January 10, 2018 (pp. 8, 10, and 13): ""3.2.a With all due respect, the Resolution that dismissed this present case took an 'extremely parochial"" definition of 'undesirability.' The Undersigned Complainant found it extremely hard to respond politely to the Submissions of herein Respondent in this present case; one only has to read the pleadings of herein Respondent and be able to conclude that he has no 'decent bone' in himself and he had NO qualms making FALSE ALLEGATIONS in them."" ""(6.) Corrupting courts, prosecutors and other government entities, including TAMPERING with Court Records. There have been episodes how herein respondent, through his 'lawyer-operators' would intervene in Court processes, reversal of Resolutions adverse to herein Respondent but which did NOT succeed anyway, 'operating with adverse counsel/s' of REBECCA, the Heinous TAMPERING with resolutions, Court transcripts, etcetera . . . name it, herein Respondent has DONE IT."" ""(9.) Bragging about his lawyers-operators that can achieve EVRYTHING for him. Including repeatedly 'operating on adverse counsels'; etcetera."" â¢ Vigorous Reply dated January 30, 2018 (par. 5.2 and p. 8): ""Sometimes, the Undersigned Complainant wonders if herein Respondent's Counsel 'studied and trained' under the same Law Books as the Undersigned Complainant did study and train under at the University of the Philippines College of Law. What herein Respondent's good counsel does is what is called as 'tonsorial justice,' i.e., merely picking up parts of jurisprudence and the law that suit only its own pathetic views."" ""(6.) Corrupting courts, prosecutors and other government entities, including TAMPERING with Court Records. There have been episodes of how herein Respondent, through his 'lawyer-operators' would intervene in Court processes, reversal of Resolutions adverse to herein Respondent but which did NOT succeed anyway, 'operating with adverse counsel/s' of REBECCA, the Heinous TAMPERING with resolutions, Court transcripts, etcetera . . . name it, herein Respondent has DONE IT."" (Emphasis supplied) To the Court's mind, respondent's statements confirm her arrogance and manifest lack of restraint in the use and choice of her words constituting a clear violation of Canon II, Sections 4 and 13 of the CPRA. On numerous occasions, this Court has reminded members of the Bar to abstain from any offensive personality and to refrain from any act prejudicial to the honor or reputation of a party or a witness. In keeping with the dignity of the legal profession, a lawyer's language even in their pleadings, must be dignified,[30] failing in which, they must be held administratively liable, as in this case. Conflict of interest Finally, the Court likewise agrees with the IBP that respondent cannot be held liable for conflict of interest when she filed the deportation case against complainant. Broadly, conflict of interest exists when, in behalf of one client, it is the lawyers' duty to contend for that which duty to another client requires them to oppose.[31] It is of no moment that the lawyer would not be called upon to contend for one client that which the lawyer has to oppose for the other client, or that there would be no occasion to use the confidential information acquired from one to the disadvantage of the other as the two actions are wholly unrelated. It is enough that the opposing parties in one case, one of whom would lose the suit, are present clients and the nature or conditions of the lawyer's respective retainers with each of them would affect the performance of the duty of undivided fidelity to both clients.[32] In Gimeno v. Atty. Zaide,[33] the Court explained the tests to determine whether conflict of interest exists. The Court held: In Aninon v. Sabitsana, the Court laid down the tests to determine if a lawyer is guilty of representing conflicting interests between and among his clients. One of these tests is whether the acceptance of a new relation would prevent the full discharge of a lawyer's duty of undivided fidelity and loyalty to the client or invite suspicion of unfaithfulness or double-dealing in the performance of that duty. Another test is whether a lawyer would be called upon in the new relation to use against a former client any confidential information acquired through their connection or previous employment.[34] (Citations omitted; emphasis supplied) Based on the foregoing characterization, the rule on conflict of interest applies when a lawyer-client relationship exists, the purpose of which is to protect the fiduciary nature of the ties between an attorney and their client. Evidently, the rule finds no application when no such relationship exists, as when it is the lawyer themself that files the case against the former client involving no confidential information obtained from the latter. In this case, as the IBP aptly observed, respondent was representing herself and there was no indication that she used or abused any confidential information she may previously have acquired from complainant in prosecuting the deportation case. Under these circumstances, the Court holds that the evidence on record fails to support complainant's allegation that respondent is guilty of representing conflicting interests. It bears stressing that the burden of proof in disbarment proceedings rests upon the complainant to satisfactorily prove the allegations in his complaint through substantial evidence.[35] As far as the violation of the rule against conflict of interest is concerned, complainant failed in this regard. IV A member of the Bar found administratively liable for violating the Lawyer's Oath and/or breaching the ethics of the legal profession may be penalized, or even disbarred or suspended from their office as an attorney. The appropriate penalty on an errant lawyer depends on the exercise of sound judicial discretion based on the surrounding facts.[36] Under Canon VI, Section 34(a) and (m) of the CPRA, unlawful conduct and the use of intemperate or offensive language constitute less serious offenses, which under Section 37(b), would warrant the penalties of suspension from the practice of law, fine, or both: SECTION 37. Sanctions. â (b) If the respondent is found guilty of a less serious offense, any of the following sanctions, or a combination thereof, shall be imposed: (1) Suspension from the practice of law for a period within the range of one (1) month to six (6) months, or revocation of notarial commission and disqualification as a notary public for less than two years; (2) A fine within the range of PHP 35,000.00 to PHP 100,000.00. Meanwhile, under Canon VI, Section 39 of the CPRA, the presence of one or more aggravating circumstances and absence of any mitigating circumstances may justify the Court in imposing the penalties of suspension or fine for a period or amount not exceeding double the maximum prescribed therein. Relatedly, Section 38(b) of the CPRA enumerates the circumstances which the Court may consider as aggravating, which includes the finding of previous administrative liability where a penalty is imposed, regardless of nature or gravity. On this score, the Court is cognizant of respondent's previous administrative case, entitled Martin v. Atty. Ala, docketed as A.C. No. 10556, wherein she was found administratively liable for using offensive and improper language in her pleadings and was accordingly admonished. To the Court's mind, this prior finding of administrative infraction on respondent's part shows her propensity to disregard the CPRA and violate the Lawyer's Oath. Finally, Canon VI, Section 40 of the same Code provides that ""[i]f the respondent is found liable for more than one (1) offense arising from separate acts or omissions in a single administrative proceeding, the Court shall impose separate penalties for each offense."" Here, as discussed above, respondent violated the following provisions of the CPRA: (a) Canon II, Section 2 and Canon III, particularly Section 2, when she committed unlawful conduct during the April 17, 2017 incident; and (b) Canon II, Sections 4 and 13 when she used intemperate or abusive language in her submissions before the BI. The foregoing circumstances taken together, the Court deems it proper to impose upon respondent the following penalties: (i) suspension from the practice of law for six months for violating Canon II, Section 2 and Canon III, Section 2 of the CPRA; and (ii) suspension from the practice of law for one year for violating Canon II, Sections 4 and 13 of the CPRA. Further, respondent is sternly warned that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely. ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Atty. Leticia E. Ala GUILTY of violating the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA). She is hereby meted with the following penalties, which shall be served successively, pursuant to Section 34(h) and (m), in relation to Sections 38, 39, and 40 of the CPRA: (1) SUSPENSION from the practice of law for six months for violating Canon II, Section 2 and Canon III, Section 2 of the CPRA; and (2) SUSPENSION from the practice of law for one year for violating Canon II, Sections 4 and 13 of the CPRA. Further, she is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely. The suspension from the practice of law shall take effect immediately upon receipt of this Decision. Atty. Leticia E. Ala is DIRECTED to immediately file a Manifestation to the Court that her suspension has started stating the exact date of receipt of this Decision, copy furnished all courts and quasi-judicial bodies where she has entered her appearance as counsel. Let a copy of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant to be appended to Atty. Leticia E. Ala's personal record as an attorney, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for its information and guidance and the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all the courts. After completing her suspension, Atty. Leticia E. Ala shall file with the Office of the Bar Confidant a Sworn Statement pursuant to Section 45 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability.

No. 268979 JEFFREY ROSACAY EMPUERTO AND LEONIDO AND ROSALYN EMPUERTO, PETITIONERS, VS. SHEENA OLPOC CABRILLOS, RESPONDENT. February 05, 2025",,"The Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed before this Court assails the Court of Appeals' September 27, 2022 Resolution,[2] October 18, 2022 Decision,[3] and July 19, 2023 Resolution,[4] and prays for the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order against the execution of the Regional Trial Court's May 5, 2021 Order.[5] On February 26, 2013, Sheena Olpoc Cabrillos (Sheena) gave birth to Yuno Hanzo Cabrillos Empuerto (Yuno).[6] Jeffrey Rosacay Empuerto (Jeffrey) acknowledged being Yuno's father. He and Sheena lived in Davao City with his parents, spouses Leonido and Rosalyn Empuerto (Spouses Empuerto). Sometime in 2017, Sheena broke up with Jeffrey and left with Yuno to live with her parents in Cotabato City, where she enrolled Yuno to a local elementary school. Despite the distance, Jeffrey constantly communicated with Yuno and regularly had Yuno stay with him in Davao City for holidays and vacations.[7] On March 13, 2020, Jeffrey brought Yuno back to Davao City for his summer vacation. Yuno' s stay was extended due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Sheena asked Jeffrey to bring Yuno back to her after the lockdown, but her plea was ignored. On July 6, 2020, Sheena went to Davao City to fetch Yuno, but Jeffrey and Spouses Empuerto (collectively, the Empuertos) refused to hand over the child.[8] On August 6, 2020, with the assistance of police officers and a local social worker, Sheena tried to fetch Yuno again. Yuno refused to go with her.[9] Sheena requested assistance from the Office of the Punong Barangay, where she and Jeffrey agreed to turn over custody of Yuno at the end of his classes in April 2021.[10] In April 2021, Jeffrey failed to give Yuno to Sheena, prompting her to file a police blotter of Jeffrey's failure to comply with the barangay agreement and a petition for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus before the trial court.[11] On May 3, 2021, the Regional Trial Court of Davao City issued a writ of habeas corpus requiring the Empuertos to appear and bring Yuno to court on May 5, 2021.[12] All the parties and their lawyers appeared during the May 5, 2021 hearing for the writ's implementation, but only Jeffrey and Sheena were called for a preliminary conference inside the judge's chamber.[13] During the conference, Jeffrey and Sheena agreed on certain terms for Yuno's custody, which were incorporated in the May 5, 2021 Regional Trial Court Order: 1. The custody of the child as stated in the earlier Order shall be turned over to the mother after the child's class on July 2021; 2. During the custody of the child with the father and the custody of the child with the mother after July, constant communication shall be maintained by the parties and the child. After July while the child is already in the custody of the mother, constant communication shall only be for once a week for one (1) month in order for the mother to establish more her relationship with the child; 3. The mother shall always take care and protect the child from any forms of abuse including but not limited to the members of her household; 4. During long vacation, this includes Christmas time, Holy Week celebration[,] and summer season, the custody of the child shall be with the father. For Christmas vacation, after the child's Christmas break from his class up to December 30, 2021, the custody shall be with the father[,] and during New Year celebration, the custody shall be with the mother; 5. The mother[,] while the custody of the child is with her, shall see to it that all the personal belongings of the child shall be used by him and all the toys belonging to him[] shall only be played [with] by him. Considering that the said agreement entered into by the parties is not contrary to law, morals, good customs and public policy, the same is hereby APPROVED. Parties are directed to faithfully comply with the terms and conditions as stated and enumerated above. Failure to do so, the Court will impose the corresponding sanctions and penalties. Mr. Orlando S. Acosta, Sheriff IV of this Court, is hereby directed to serve this Order on July 2021 or after the class of the subject child with the assistance of the social worker, and to direct the turn[]over of custody from the father to the mother, the petitioner herein. In serving this Order, said Sheriff may ask for the assistance of any law enforcement agencies to ensure what has been agreed upon by the parties and approved by this Court will be complied with, taking into consideration the best interest and welfare of the child. With the said approval of the Compromise Agreement, this case is hereby CLOSED and TERMINATED. SO ORDERED.[14] The Empuertos moved for reconsideration, demanding a full-blown trial. The Regional Trial Court denied their motion in its June 11, 2021 Order,[15] stating that since the issue of custody had been determined and the parties had entered into a compromise agreement, the petition for habeas corpus was therefore deemed resolved and the case was terminated.[16] Based on his Sheriff's Return and Report dated July 28, 2021,[17] Sheriff Orlando Acostaâtogether with Sheena, Social Worker Jovelyn Trajano, and Social Worker Dominique Fuentesâserved to Jeffrey the May 5, 2021 Order for turnover of the custody of the child. Yuno refused to go with his mother Sheena despite Jeffrey's cooperation.[18] Subsequently, the Empuertos filed an Urgent Verified Motion for Preliminary Restraints[19] before the Court of Appeals, which sought to (1) restrain the execution of the trial court's order pending its appeal and (2) remand the case for a full-blown trial to determine rightful custody of the child. In its September 27, 2022 Resolution,[20] the Court of Appeals denied the prayer for preliminary injunction, citing the Empuertos' failure to establish their clear, unmistakable right of custody over Yuno and the material invasion of this right:[21]","Here, there is undeniably an apparent dearth of supporting reasons in the trial court's ruling with respect to the existence of such facts, circumstances, and conditions that is most congenial for Winston's survival, protection, and feelings of security encouraging to his physical, psychological, and emotional development. Indeed, the [Regional Trial Court] ruling failed to consider such factors enumerated in Section 14 of the Rule on Custody of Minors as the ""health, safety and welfare of [Winston],"" the ""habitual use of alcohol, dangerous drugs or regulated substances,"" the ""most suitable physical, emotional, spiritual, psychological[,] and educational environment for [Winston's] holistic development and growth"" and ""Winston's preference,"" including any circumstances that may be detrimental to Winston's growth and development, in resolving to award custody to respondent. In the Court's view, the [Regional Trial Court's] overreliance on the evidence of respondent's parentage in awarding custody over Winston constituted grave jurisdictional error or such whimsical, capricious, and arbitrary exercise of discretion. Not only does this ruling violate the express legal provision granting parental authority to the mother with respect to illegitimate children and[,] in case of her death, to the persons specifically authorized to exercise substitute parental authority. More importantly, such error effectively amounted to an abandonment of [the trial court's] legal and moral duty to rule in the best interest of the minor. It bears reemphasizing that the law and the Rules mandate that the best interest of the minor must be the primordial consideration in the determination of who should rightfully exercise custody and parental authority.[75] (Emphasis in the original)","WHEREFORE, the Urgent Verified Motion for Preliminary Restraints is hereby DENIED. Further, this Court resolves to â 1. NOTE respondents-appellants' Manifestation/Compliance with attached payment of the Sheriff's Trust Fund (STF) and TRO fee in the amount of [PHP] 2,300.00 filed on December 10, 2021. 2. NOTE the Memorandum for respondents-appellants filed on January 6, 2022. 3. DEEM petitioner-appellee to have waived the filing of â (a) Memorandum; and (b) Comment on respondents-appellants' Urgent Verified Motion for Preliminary Restraints, in view of the CMIS verification report dated June 10, 2022 that none has been filed as of date, despite receipt of the Notice to File Memorandum and this Court's November 10, 2021 Minute Resolution by petitioner-appellee both on December 22, 2021. Accordingly, the instant case is DECLARED submitted for decision.

Instantaneously. Contrary to law.[6] On his arraignment on December 12, 2013, Lastimosa pleaded not guilty.[7] Version of the Prosecution The evidence for the prosecution rested mainly on the testimonies of Dureza Vega (Dureza), Elmer CaÃ±eda (CaÃ±eda), and Vicente Cortes (Cortes). The CA summarized their testimonies as follows: Their combined testimonies show that on November 17, 2012, at around 4:30 in the afternoon, CaÃ±eda was going out of the cockpit located at Sugarland, Cansojong, Talisay, Cebu, when he saw Ildefonso Vega (Ildefonso) riding on his [motorcycle], who was two (2) to three (3) meters away from him (CaÃ±eda). Ildefonso was standing on his motorcycle as he could not get out at that time. Suddenly, [Lastimosa] shot Ildefonso three (3) times hitting him on his right jaw. Consequently, Ildefonso and his motorcycle fell on the ground. After shooting Ildefonso, [Lastimosa] rode a motorcycle driven by an [un]identified person, unfortunately, the [motorcycle] did not start immediately and the helmet [Lastimosa] was holding fell on the ground. Ca[Ã±]eda helped Ildefonso board a vehicle which brought him (Ildefonso) to the hospital. Cortes corroborated the testimony of Ca[Ã±]eda on the fact of shooting. He narrated that he is six (6) meters away from Ildefonso and [Lastimosa], when he saw the latter [shoot] the former. Dureza was tending to their carenderia in Poblacion, Talisay, Cebu when she was informed by a certain Monching Canton that her husband, Ildefonso[,] was shot to death.

An autopsy was conducted at the St. Francis Funeral. She spen[t] the amount of [PHP] 80,000.00 in connection with the death of her husband. The deceased Ildefonso is engaged in making gaff and earns around [PHP] 50,000.00 per month.[8] Version of the Defense Meanwhile, the evidence of the defense mainly rested on the testimonies of Lastimosa and his live-in partner, Maria Amie Paquit[9] (Paquit). The CA summarized their testimonies in the following manner: In sum, [Lastimosa] and his witness narrates a tale of denial and alibi. [Lastimosa] asserts that on November 17, 2012 at around 4:30 in the afternoon, he was at his rented residence in Barangay San Roque, Cebu City, with his live-in partner for ten (10) years, Mary Ann Bargamento. He denied having gone as there was never a chance to go to Cansojong, Talisay, Cebu City, on the said date. The only shooting incident he was involved with pertains to the incident in Dumlog, Talisay, which was already settled by his brother. Ildefonso and [Lastimosa] were jailmates and friends while in Maghaway City Jail sometime in 2007 or 2008. After he was released in 2012, he never met Ildefonso, thus, he was devastated when he was arrested in September 9, 2013 for Murder. Prior to the incident, he does not know prosecution witnesses CaÃ±eda and Cortes and only saw them inside the [courtroom].[10]","This is an appeal seeking to reverse and set aside the February 11, 2022 Decision[3] of the Court of Appeals, Cebu City (CA) in CA-G.R.

Also, all monetary awards for damages shall earn interest at the legal rate of 6% per annum from finality of this decision until fully paid. Finally, in the service of his sentence, accused, who is a detention prisoner, shall be credited with the entire period during which he has undergone preventive imprisonment. SO ORDERED.[11] The RTC held that the shooting and killing of Ildefonso Vega, Jr. (Ildefonso) is clear and undisputed, as evidenced by his Certificate of Death.[12] It observed that Ildefonso died of gunshot wounds to his head and neck. It relied on the positive identification by CaÃ±eda and Cortes of Lastimosa as the author of the crime. It cited CaÃ±eda's testimony that he was two to three meters away when he saw Lastimosa shoot Ildefonso three times, hitting him at the right side of his jaw. It discounted the fact that CaÃ±eda only surfaced after a month from the incident as the delay does not impair his credibility. Besides, CaÃ±eda's testimony is buttressed by that of Cortes. It did not give any weight to Lastimosa's defense of denial and alibi, more so as it was shown that Lastimosa requested Paquit to testify in his favor. Also, it was not physically impossible for Lastimosa to have been at the crime scene on November 17, 2012 when the incident occurred since his place of residence in Cebu City and the crime scene in Talisay City are only about an hour's travel apart.[13] The RTC did not find that the killing of Ildefonso was attended by treachery and evident premeditation. As to treachery, it observed that CaÃ±eda did not describe the manner by which Lastimosa attacked Ildefonso. CaÃ±eda merely stated that Lastimosa shot Ildefonso three times and then Ildefonso and his motorcycle fell to the ground. There is no evidence to determine whether Ildefonso had no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate, or that Lastimosa consciously adopted the means of execution. As to evident premeditation, it held that there is no proof as to when Lastimosa determined to commit the crime, that he clung to his determination, and that sufficient time elapsed from his determination to the execution to allow him to reflect on the consequences of the act.[14] At this juncture, it would be proper to note that the prosecution presented a photocopy of the death certificate of Ildefonso during the direct testimony of Dureza on June 26, 2014, viz.: Fiscal Macion: (to witness) Q You mentioned that your husband was autopsied, was there any government issued a [sic] document? A Yes. Q What is that document, Madam Witness? A I have a Death Certificate. Q I am showing to you a Certificate of Death prepared by the manager of St. Francis Memorial Homes, is this the one you are referring to? Court: That is just a [x]erox copy, Fiscal. Fiscal Macion: Yes, Your Honor. Fiscal Macion: (to witness) Q Madam Witness, do you have the original copy of the Death Certificate? A I have it in my house. Fiscal Macion: May I ask for the continuance, Your Honor. Court: Let's have the continuation of the examination of this witness, when?[15] During the continuation of Dureza's direct testimony on August 28, 2014, the prosecution again presented a photocopy of the death certificate of Ildefonso. Said photocopy was temporarily marked as Exhibit ""B"" for purposes of identification, viz.: COURT: For the continuation of the direct. Dureza Vega, you are testifying under the same oath. WITNESS: Yes, Your Honor. COURT: Proceed Fiscal. FISCAL MACION: (to Witness) Q: The last time you testified Madam Witness, you mentioned that there was a death certificate issued in connection with the death of your husband, did you bring the original copy with you? (witness showing the death certificate) COURT: Mura manag xerox copy, let me see, ......... this is a xerox copy, kuha ug original. WITNESS: Abi nako original ni. FISCAL MACION: I'll just make some other questions Your Honor..... COURT: Alright, proceed. FISCAL MACION: We'll just make a temporary marking Your Honor, on the death certificate, Your Honor, and we ask that..... COURT: There [is] no admission of the fact of death here of the victim..... FISCAL MACION: That the photocopy of the death certificate be temporary mark [sic] as our Exhibit ""B"", Your Honor. COURT: Only for purposes of identification, [m]ark it as Exhibit ""B[.]""[16] While the RTC appeared to have relied on the photocopy of the death certificate in its Decision, expressly stating that the shooting and killing of Ildefonso is evidenced by said certificate,[17] the Decision fails to expressly discuss the admissibility and credibility of the photocopy of the death certificate. Lastimosa appealed the RTC Decision before the CA, where he raised the following lone error: THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.[18] Lastimosa argued that his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt on the following grounds: ""(1) the corpus delicti was not proven; and (2) the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are not credible, hence, underserving of faith and credence.""[19] On the issue of the corpus delicti, Lastimosa harped on the failure of the prosecution to present the original death certificate of Ildefonso. He asseverated that said photocopy, not having been authenticated, is inadmissible in evidence and has no probative value. Lastimosa claimed that there is no proof that the death of Ildefonso was the proximate result of his act. Thus, the corpus delicti of the crime was not proven. As to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, he insisted that they are not credible since they lack essential details of the incident.[20] The Ruling of the CA In its February 11, 2022 Decision, the CA denied Lastimosa's appeal, but modified the RTC's ruling from a conviction of Homicide to Murder. Its dispositive portion reads as follows:","The Ruling of the RTC In its June 1, 2018 Judgment, the RTC found Lastimosa guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Homicide. Its dispositive portion reads as follows: IN VIEW THEREOF, accused YBO LASTIMOSA is found guilty of Homicide and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence of eight (8) years and one (1) day of [prision mayor] medium as minimum, and fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of [reclusion temporal] medium as maximum; and to pay the heirs of Ildefonso Vega, Jr. the sum of [PHP] 75,000.00 as civil indemnity for his death; [PHP] 50,000.00 as Moral Damages for the pain and anguish suffered by the heirs as a result of his death; Temperate damages in the amount of [PHP] 25,000.00; and Exemplary damages in the amount of [PHP] 25,000.00, all indemnifications are without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. Also, all monetary awards for damages shall earn interest at the legal rate of 6% per annum from finality of this decision until fully paid. Finally, in the service of his sentence, accused, who is a detention prisoner, shall be credited with the entire period during which he has undergone preventive imprisonment.
